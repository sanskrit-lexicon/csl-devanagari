<H>Foreword
<P>‘What is there in a name?’ There is definitely much more in
a name than may appear to be the case on a superficial survey.
Names may appear to be quite casual, so much so that the
man bearing them has hardly any say in the matter. We find
some people adopting new names or adding aliases. In many
cases the name does not have any equation with the personal
qualities of the man concerned. The titles assumed by a
man may reflect something of his inner personality, his
ambitions, and his emotional complexes; the epithets bes-
towed by others, if not created by greedy flatterers, reveal
his assessment in the eyes of others. Whereas the surnames
may often depend on the accident of birth in a given family or
a social group, the personal names are labelled long before
any of the recognisable attributes begin to emerge. The story
of names would have assumed a highly romantic colour if the
names had been assumed by people and had not been thrust
upon them.
<P>The names may not reveal the man, but they do provide
penetrating peeps into his family, his society and his times. The
name-patterns have a vital connexion with the social realities
and cultural values of the group to which they belong. There is
a distinct individuality in them and they reflect in a microscopic
miniature the traditions and values of the people concerned.
Poeple do not take to names in as casual a manner as they are
sometimes taken to do. Of all the people the Indians seem to
show a much serious concern for the question of names and to
have set down definite rules governing their formation. These
rules are not mere grammatical ones to cover the linguistic
forms of the names. There are prescriptive norms and prohibi-
tive rules in accordance with the socio-cultural traditions and the
advancements made in various fields of knowledge. Not many
[Pagetitle-viii+ 39]
nations of antiquity can claim a parallel progress in this area
of culture. These elaborate rules did not result merely from
the typically Indian genius for systematisation and elaboration
of its fund of knowledge in all spheres. It arose out of a cons-
cious appreciation of the significance of names and their great
relevance for the cultural traditions. The rules about names
prescribed in the grammatical works and the Gṛhyasūtras and
the Smṛtis were elaborated in subsequent times and led to the
composition of separate treatises on various aspects and
problems connected with the giving of names.
<P>The names can provide a reliable clue to the understanding
of the socio-cultural life. They can serve as a barometer for
recording the historical realities of culture in a particular period.
A study of the name-patterns can be a useful measuring rod
for a historian; but, it has been rarely used. A name can reveal
the personal equipment of the bestowing parents and also their
emotional concern for their child. Above all, it tells us about
the gods and goddesses and their comparative popularity, the
religious ideas and beliefs current among the people, the social
structure and the differences in the various social groups, and
the realities of the linguistic phenomenon. In view of the
elaborate rules about the grammatical, astronomical, religious
and social considerations, an analysis of the pattern of names
in different historical periods can give us a vital indication of
the extent to which the traditional rules were respected and of
the influences which were introducing changes in the traditional
beliefs and systems.
<P>Considering the rich possibilities in a historical and com-
parative analysis of the name-patterns, it is surprising indeed
that, with a few singular exceptions, historians have not paid
to this area of study the serious attention it deserves. Obviously
this type of study is more demanding in respect of the discip-
lines involved. The historian, who undertakes the work, has to
possess a comprehensive knowledge of different aspects of an
ancient society. He has to combine a knowledge of Sanskrit
grammar and linguistics with a proficiency in palaeography and
competence to handle the original texts bearing on the subject.
Happily Dr. Tej Ram Sharma, one of my early research
scholars, assiduously cultivated the qualities and acquired the
[Pagetitle-ix+ 23]
necessary command over the concerned disciplines. It is gratify-
ing to find that Dr. Sharma has produced a first-rate study on
the subject and has covered himself up with glory.
<P>The study of the Gupta period of Indian history has been
enriched by the contributions of many a competent scholar.
But, without there being any significant addition to the original
sources, some of the many publications have only been
reproducing already well-known material. The approach
adopted in these studies being regularly repetitive has acquired
a chilling monotonousness. Dr. Sharma deserves commenda-
tion for attempting an analysis of the culture of the Gupta
period from an altogether new angle. His fresh approach
has imparted a living warmth to the socio-cultural life of
the period. Dr. Sharma has definitely made signficant improve-
ment upon our understanding of the Classical Age of Indian
history.
<P>In introducing the present study to the world of scholars I
must express my fervent desire and sincere hope that the pre-
sent publication will be followed by many other scholarly
studies by Dr. Sharma.

<H>Preface
<P>It may be pointed out at the outset that the inscriptions
included in the list could not be arranged in chronological order
as they were included during the work as and when noticed
and found available. We did not like to disturb the order as
arranged by J. F. Fleet in his {%Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum,%}
Vol. III and further added to the list the other inscriptions which
he could not include in his work due to their non-availability and
non-publication at the time when he published his work. The
criterion for the selection of the inscriptions and the seals has
been the relevance with the Gupta history and the area suppo-
sed to be under the direct rule of the Guptas.
<P>The present work, to some extent, is a break-away from
the traditional type of research. This work follows the lines set
in by F.T. Wainright and Dr. H.D. Sankalia in their works
{%Archaeology and place-names and History%} and {%Studies in%}
{%the Historical and Cultural Geography and Ethnography of%}
{%Gujarat%} respectively.
<P>Some people may ward off the idea in a name by saying
merely “what is in a name?” But we find even now the people
taking time to give a name to their child. They may even
sometime talk about the justification of the name by the child
which is expressed by a Sanskrit dictum {%yathā nāma tathā%}
{%guṇaḥ.%}
<P>A person is identified by his name by the family members
as well as by others. Man lives with his name in this life and
even after death the name survives. There is a taboo about
the secret name not to be disclosed or made known to others
for fear of sorcery or black-magic or ill-effect by the spirits.
<P>It may also be mentioned that some people may give the
names to their children quite thoughtfully — it may be after a
god, a hero, a character from some fiction, while others may
[Pagetitle-xiv+ 39]
imitate them without knowing or understanding any meaning or
thought pregnant in the names.
<P>It may be argued whether the names are connotative or not
but who can refuse their cultural significance or their bearing
on the cultural life of society. The bulk of a particular type of
names may signify the preponderance of certain customs or
predominance of some cults and traits in a society. We are
primarily concerned with this factor in our study on the per-
sonal names in the Gupta inscriptions.
<P>In the study of the geographical names we are not only
concerned with their identification but also with their origin,
cultural significance as well as the linguistic changes. The
geographical names may represent the important personages,
social beliefs in a society and its cultural habitat. The present
work aims at the following objectives.
<P>(i) To ascertain the historical facts proved by other evidence;
<P>(ii) To correctly check up certain disputed readings in the
inscriptions;
<P>(iii) To correctly interpret some disputed passages in the
inscriptions;
<P>(iv) To accord a scientific tinge to already known material on
the tribes as well as the place-names in the light of the
new material published through a number of monographs
on the subject.
<P>The works on personal names are very few. In India a work
of the type of {%Your Baby's name%} by Maxwell Nurnberg and
Morris Rosenblum, has yet to be carried out, where the original
history of English names has been worked out, statis-
tics are given of its use by estimated number of people and
ranked accordingly and the connotations given along with the
citations from literature. The names for the boys and girls
have also been classified separately.
<P>The present study, originally a doctoral thesis accepted by
the Banaras Hindu University in 1968, seeks to discuss separa-
tely different name-patterns with regard to personal names,
names of tribes, places, rivers and mountains, though in a modest
way. I owe special gratitude to Dr. V.S. Pathak of the Gorakhpur
University and Dr. L. Gopal of the Banaras Hindu University,
who helped me through this work. I feel highly obliged to
[Pagetitle-xv+ 21]
Dr. L. Gopal for writing a Foreword to this book. The award of
a Research Fellowship by the University Grants Commission,
New Delhi which enabled me to complete the dissertation, is
very gratefully acknowledged.
<P>Other scholars who helped me by way of valuable sugges-
tions are:
<P>Dr. A.K. Narain, Dr. H.D. Sankalia, Dr. D.C. Sircar,
Dr. G.C. Pande, Dr. Romila Thapar, Dr. A.M. Ghatage,
Dr. M.A. Mahendale, Dr. Mantrini Prasad, Dr. Parmanand
Gupta, and Prof. N. K.S. Telang.
<P>The courtesy of the Archaeological Survey of India in
making available photographs reproduced in this book is
gratefully acknowledged.
<P>Lastly, but not the least, I express my sincere thanks to
my wife Brij and daughter Richa who gladly spared me the
time for giving the present shape to the work.

PERSONAL NAMES

[Page-003+ 34]
<H>Prologue
<P>Nominal languages, such as the Greenlandish and the
Nauhatt, represent the earliest stage in the development of
linguistic structures. They consisted mostly of the object-
words, which denoted the objects and also action and quality.
In the nominal languages, object-words (names) emerged out
of proper names. In the early stages of a language, the first
words are names, and all names are primarily proper names.
Generic names, like man, animal and tree, evolve later and
abstractions, like courage, ferocity, and greenness, later still.<sup>1</sup>
A proper name is a symbol pointing to one and only one
person, or place. Primitive man felt that the relationship
between name and thing was close and intimate. This fraction
formed the basis for rituals pertaining to propitiation and
incantation. The mishandling of a name in speech might imply
insult or may result in injury to the bearer of the name.<sup>2</sup>
<P>Even in regard to generic names we have to keep certain
limitations in view. Yāska states that we find convenience in
restricting the use of words otherwise they may bring about
confusion.<sup>3</sup>
<P>A personal name consists of a surname and that part of
name which is variously called as the first name or the Christian
name. Surname consists of the Caste-suffix or Gotra, Pravara
and Śākhā. Sometimes it may consist of Gotra or family
appellation alone. Many surnames are derived from the
principal professions the people followed or the crafts they
practised, and in the majority of cases, are still engaged in.
Some surnames give clue to the original habitat of a people,
even though they have migrated elsewhere. Others point to
the ethnic groups a people belonged. Thus surnames are
important from Historical, Cultural, and Ethnological point of
view.
<P>First names are primarily devised to denote<sup>4</sup> and not to
connote, though at times fortuitously denotation may be
[Page-004+ 38]
identical with connotation.<sup>5</sup> Nevertheless, they reflect beliefs,
aspirations, cultural atmosphere and level of education of
family, head of the family or society. It is not necessary that
the names befit a thing or person as soon as it is born. Some
names are given to them after noticing their actions. {%Bilvāda%}
and {%Lambacūḍaka%} were the names of certain birds current in
Yāska's time; Amara does not mention them. The bird {%Bilvāda%}
is so called on account of its habit of eating a certain fruit
some time after its birth. In the case of {%Lambacūḍaka%}
its long crest comes into existence long after its birth and
yet it is called {%Lambacūḍaka.%}<sup>6</sup> The first part of the names of
persons generally consists of certain deities, constellations,
abstract things or other objects of nature. They are with or
without a name-ending suffix.
<P>We can study personal names with respect to time, place
and society. A certain society will not change its naming-
pattern even after the change of place. From the frequency of
a particular name in a particular region we know of the
religion, culture and the philosophy of life of the people of a
certain region. Vidyabhushan has quoted some lengthy names
giving full particulars of the persons.<sup>7</sup>
<P>Now we shall briefly review the principles of naming a
person as prescribed by the Dharmaśāstras and grammarians.
<P>We may classify the literary data about naming into four
distinct periods<sup>8</sup>:
<P>1. Vedic period
<P>2. Sūtra period
<P>3. Smṛti period
<P>4. Nibandha period
<H>VEDIC PERIOD
<P>In the Vedic period usually two names were given to a
person, one of which was a secret name, known to the parents
only. Instances of persons having three or four names are also
found. Throughout the Vedic literature the names given to a
person were his own secular name and one or more other
names derived either from his father's or grandfather's name,
or from his Gotra or from a locality or from the name of his
mother.<sup>9</sup> It is not quite clear from the Vedic literature how the
[Page-005+ 38]
secret name known only to the parents was given. Hardly any
secret name except that of Indra as Arjuna is known from the
Vedic literature.<sup>10</sup> It is to be noted that the rule as to giving the
designation of a Nakṣatra as the secret name or otherwise is
not illustrated by a single recorded name of a teacher in the
Brāhmaṇas.<sup>11</sup> The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa several times mentions
the adoption of a second name with a view to securing success,
and also refers to the adoption of another name for purposes
of distinction.<sup>12</sup>
<H>SŪTRA PERIOD
<P>The Gṛhya-sūtras provide us details about the name-giving
ceremony, the secret name, the common name, the {%abhivāda-%}
{%nīya%} name, the quality of the name as well as the formation of
the names of the boys and girls.
<H>{%Name-giving ceremony%}
<P>The Śāṅkhāyana<sup>13</sup> and the Pāraskara<sup>14</sup> Gṛhya-sūtras pres-

cribe the name-giving ceremony to be performed on the tenth
day after the birth of the child but usually the Gṛhya-sūtras
recommend its performance after ten nights have elapsed.<sup>15</sup>
The Gṛhya-sūtras consider the first ten days after the birth of
the child as of impurity. Hence it is prescribed by the Hiraṇ-
yakeśin<sup>16</sup> that on the twelfth day the mother and son take a
bath, the house is made clean, the {%Sūtikāgni%} is taken away and
the {%Aupāsanāgni%} is established. Having put wood on that fire,
and having performed the rites down to the {%vyāhṛti%} oblations,
they sacrifice twelve oblations with the verses, “May Dhatri
give us wealth”; according to some (teachers they make)
thirteen (oblations). This, O Varuṇa ‘Hail, good luck?’ Then
let the father give the name to the child.
<P>The Gobhila Gṛhya-sūtra is very liberal with regard to the
performance of the name-giving ceremony as it says, “When
ten nights have elapsed after (the child's) birth, or a hundred
nights, or one year, the {%Nāmadheyakaraṇa%} (or giving a name
to the child) is performed”.<sup>17</sup> Gobhila<sup>18</sup> details the ceremony
as follows: He who is going to perform that ceremony, the
father or a representative of the father, sits down to the west
of the fire on northward-pointed {%Darbha%} grass, facing the east.
[Page-006+ 38]
Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment,
hands him, from south to north, with his face turned to the
north, to the performer of the ceremony. She then passes
behind his back and sits down to the north of him, on north-
ward pointed {%Darbha%} grass. He then sacrifices to Prajāpati, to
the {%Tithi%} of the Child's birth, to the {%Nakṣatra%} of the child's
birth, and to the presiding deity of that Tithi and of that {%Nakṣatra.%}
He then murmurs the {%Mantra,%} “Who art thou? What art thou?,
touching the sense-organs at the boy's head. In the passage of
the {%Mantra:%} “Enter upon the month that belongs to Ahaspati
(i.e., the lord of the days), N.N.” After this the performer of
the rite should first announce the child's name to the mother.<sup>19</sup>
Further the sacrificial fee of a cow is recommended.<sup>20</sup>
<P>Pāraskara,<sup>21</sup> however, makes this ceremony very simple
when it states, “On the tenth day (after the birth of the child)
the father, having made (his wife) get up, and having fed the
brāhmaṇas, gives a name to the child”.
<H>{%The Secret Name%}
<P>The secret name is given to the child immediately after the
birth of the child or even before when the rite for quick
delivery is to be performed. As prescribed by the Gobhila
Gṛhya-sūtra, the father pronounces a name in the formula:
“A male will be born, such-and-such by name”; and the name
is kept secret.<sup>22</sup> Āpastamba<sup>23</sup> prescribes that the father gives
the name to the new-born child soon after his birth. This is a
{%Nakṣatra%} name and is secret. The Khādira Gṛhya-sūtra<sup>24</sup> also
prescribes that the secret name should be given immediately
after the birth of the child. Śaṅkhāyana<sup>25</sup> prescribes the giving
of the secret name by the father after feeding the new-born
child with a mixture of butter, honey, milk-curds and water,
or grind together rice and barley, from a golden vessel or with
a golden spoon. The Hiraṇyakeśin Gṛhya-sūtra,<sup>26</sup> however,
prescribes that on the twelfth day itself, the father should give
the child two names out of which the second name should be a
{%Nakṣatra%} name. The one name should be secret and by the
other they should call him.
<P>This means that according to Hiraṇyakeśin the secret name
may not essentially be a {%Nakṣatra%} name.
[Page-007+ 36]
<H>{%The Common Name%}
<P>A common name or a name for public use is given to the
child after the tenth day at the time of the performance of the
name-giving ceremony. Śaṅkhāyana<sup>27</sup> prescribes that the name
should be pleasing to the brāhmaṇas.
<H>{%The Abhivādanīya Name%}
<P>The Āśvalāyana Gṛhya-sūtra<sup>28</sup> prescribes that along with
the common name, the father may also find out for the child,
a name to be used at respectful salutations, such as that due
to the {%Ācārya%} at the ceremony of initiation; that name only
his mother and father should know till his initiation. While
the Gobhila Gṛhya-sūtra<sup>29</sup> prescribes that the {%abhivādanīya%}
name should be given by the teacher when the student comes
for study. The teacher chooses for him a name which he is to
use at respectful salutations — a name derived from the name of
a deity or a {%Nakṣatra.%} Or also of his Gotra, according to some
teachers.
<H>{%The Quality of the Name%}
<P>All the Gṛhya-sūtras unanimously agree that the name of
the son should begin with a sonant,<sup>30</sup> with a semi-vowel in it,
with a long vowel or the {%visarga%} at the end, and formed with a
{%kṛta%} suffix and it should not contain a {%taddhita%} suffix with an
even number<sup>31</sup> of syllables.<sup>32</sup> The Āśvalāyana Gṛhya-sūtra
says that the name should consist of two, or of four syllables.
Of two syllables, if he is desirous of firm position; of four
syllables, if he is desirous of holy lustre; but in every case
with an even number of syllables for men.<sup>33</sup>
<P>The Gṛhya-sūtras of Āpastamba<sup>34</sup> and Hiraṇyakeśin,<sup>35</sup> on
the authority of a Brāhmaṇa, prescribe the option of a name
containing the particle {%su,%} for such a name has a firm found-
ation. Pāraskara adds further that the name of a brāhmaṇa
should end in {%Śarman,%} that of a kṣatriya in {%Varman%} and that of
a vaiśya in {%Gupta.%}<sup>36</sup> Hiraṇyakeśin<sup>37</sup> prescribes two names for a
brāhmaṇa desirous of success. The second name should be a
{%Nakṣatra%} name. The one name should be secret and by the
other the parents should call the child. He further prescribes
[Page-008+ 37]
that the father should give him the name {%Somayājin%} i.e.,
performer of soma sacrifices, as his third name.<sup>38</sup>
<P>The name derived from the deity or {%Nakṣatra%} was permit-
ted using god's name but directly using god's name as the name
of an individual was forbidden.<sup>39</sup> The name of the father was
to be avoided but the child could be given the name of one of
his ancestors.<sup>40</sup>
<H>{%The Names of the Girls%}
<P>While some Gṛhya-sūtras<sup>41</sup> are silent about the names of
the girls, others<sup>42</sup> prescribe some rules for framing their names
as well:
<P>({%i%}) The name of a girl should have an odd number of
syllables.<sup>43</sup>
<P>({%ii%}) It should end in {%ā,%} with a {%taddhita%} suffix.<sup>44</sup>
<P>({%iii%}) It should end in {%dā.<sup>45</sup>%}
<P>({%iv%}) Āpastamba<sup>46</sup> says that girls who have the name of a
{%Nakṣatra,%} or of a river, or of a tree, are objectionable.
<P>This finds an echo later in the Manu-Smṛti where the girls
bearing such names are forbidden for marriage.<sup>47</sup>
<P>({%v%}) The Āpastamba Gṛhya-sūtra<sup>48</sup> also states that all girls
in whose names the last letter but one is {%r%} or {%l,%} one
should avoid in wooing.
<P>({%vi%}) The name of a girl should not end in {%dattā%} or {%rakṣitā%}
preceded by the name of a deity; etc.<sup>49</sup>
<P>We find some distinguishing characteristics between the
names of the boys and the girls. The names of the boys are
prescribed to end in {%visarga%} while of the girls with {%ā%} or {%dā.%}
The names of the boys are ordained to end with a {%kṛta%} suffix
while of the girls with a {%taddhita%} suffix. But the rules prohibi-
ting certain kinds of names for girls were frequently violated
or continued to be violated as is evident from numerous such
examples in literature.
<H>SMṚTI PERIOD
<P>Manu simplifies the system and lays down the following
four simple rules:
<P>({%i%}) A name should be given to a child on the 10th or 12th
day on a pious date, {%Muhūrta%} or {%Nakṣatra.%}<sup>50</sup>
[Page-009+ 38]
<P>({%ii%}) The name of a brāhmaṇa should be indicative of
{%maṅgala,%} of a kṣatriya strength, of a vaiśya wealth
and of śūdra lowness.<sup>51</sup>
<P>({%iii%}) To the name of a brāhmaṇa an {%upapada%} (suffix) should
be joined indicating {%śarman%} (happiness or blessing); of
a king an {%upapada%} connected with protection; of a
vaiśya indicating prosperity and of a śūdra indicating
dependence or service.<sup>52</sup>
<P>({%iv%}) The names of women should be easily pronounced,
clear, charming, auspicious, ending in long vowel and
should be full of blessings.<sup>53</sup>
<P>Manu omits the elaborate rules about giving a name in the
case of males, and does not make any reference to the {%Nakṣatra%}
name or {%abhivādanīya%} name given to a boy.
<H>NIBANDHA PERIOD
<P>The Mitākṣarā, a commentary on the Yājñavalkya Smṛti,
quotes Śaṅkha, who says that a father should give to his son a
name connected with a family deity.<sup>54</sup>
<P>There is another way of deriving names from {%Nakṣatras.%}
In some of the medieval Jyotiṣa works, each of the 27
{%Nakṣatras%} is divided into four {%pādas,%} and to each {%pāda%} of a
{%Nakṣatra%} a specific letter is assigned (e.g. {%cu, ce, co,%} and {%la%} for
the four {%pādas%} of Aśvinī) from which a person born in a
particular {%pāda%} of Aśvinī was called Cūḍāmaṇi, Cedīśa, Coleśa,
or Lakṣmaṇa.<sup>55</sup> These names are called {%Nakṣatra-nāma;%} they
are secret and muttered into the ear of the brahmacārin at his
{%upanayana%} even now. Even so late a work as the Dharma-
sindhu (A.D. 1790) disapproves of names, not warranted by the
Smṛtis.
<P>Now we consider the views of grammarians on naming a
person.
<P>Pāṇini divides the names into four principal classes.<sup>56</sup>
<P>(1) Gotra names mentioned in Chapter 4, {%pāda%} 1 of the
Aṣṭādhyāyī, e.g. Gārgya.

<P>Patañjali in his Mahābhāṣya mentions Pāṇini by matro-
nymic.<sup>57</sup>
<P>He says that parents name their child some days after his
birth just as Devadatta and Yajñadatta and as a result other
people also know him by the same name.<sup>58</sup>
<P>The Aṅgavijjā,<sup>59</sup> a work generally placed in the third
century, has much useful material about names. The 26th
chapter of this work is devoted to proper names. The general
rules prescribed for naming the persons are as follows:
<P>The names of men were formed from {%gottanāma, ayanāma%}
(constellations), {%kamma%} (profession), {%sarīra%} (body) {%karaṇa%}
(office)<sup>60</sup> Under {%aya%} are quoted the examples {%kinnaka, kata-%}
{%raka, chadditaka. Sarīra%} names are qualitative. They are {%saṇḍa%}
(bull), {%vikaḍa%} (terrible), {%kharaḍa%} (lowest), {%khallaḍa%} (bald), {%vipiṇa%}
(forest).<sup>61</sup>
<P>The friendly names ended with the suffixes {%ṇandi, nanda,%}
{%diṇṇa, ṇandaka%} and {%nandika.%}<sup>62</sup>
<P>The names indicating defects of the body are {%khaṇḍasīsa%}
(broken head), {%kāṇa%} (blind of one eye), {%pillaka%} (discarded),
{%kujja%} (hunchback), {%vāmaṇaka%} (dwarf), {%kuvi(ṇi)ka%} (lame),
{%sabala%} (spotted), {%khañja%} (lame), and {%vaḍabha%} (distorted).<sup>63</sup>
<P>Proper names were also formed on the basis of complexion,
fair complexion being designated as {%avadātaka, seḍa%} and {%seḍila;%}
light black as {%sāma, sāmali%} and {%sāmaka-sāmalā,%} and black as
{%kālaka%} and {%kālikā.%}
<P>Names based on beauty of the human body are: {%sumuha%}
(handsome), {%sudaṃsaṇa%} (pleasing personality), {%surūva%} (beauti-
ful), {%jāta%} (well-born), and {%sugata%} (pleasing gait).
<P>The names based on age are: {%bālaka%} (child), {%ḍaharaka%}
(boy), {%majjhima%} (middle-aged), {%thavira-thera%} (old).<sup>64</sup>
<P>The following endings of proper names are mentioned:
{%tata, dātta, diṇṇa, mitta, gutta, bhūta pāla, pāli, samma, yāsa,%}
{%rāta, ghosa, bhāṇu, viddhi, nandi, nanda, māna, uttarā, pālita,%}
{%rakhi, nandana, ṇandaka, and sahitamahaka.<sup>65</sup>%}

Vṛtra himself was killed while trying to kill Indra with the help of a

In the hymn {#इन्द्रशत्रुर्वर्धस्व#} i.e. the slayer ({%Śatru%}) of Indra should get victory,
by mistake the brāhmaṇas chanted it with the accent on the first word
which entirely changed its meaning as ‘He should be victorious, who has

<H>Names of the Gupta Kings
and Queens
NAMES OF THE GUPTA KINGS
<P>All Gupta kings excepting Ghaṭotkaca have the surname
‘gupta’ at the end. Before taking up the names of individual
Gupta kings we may discuss the significance of the term
‘gupta’. Does it signify the family (a vaiśya family) or the
predecessor of the family?
<P>In the inscriptions, Śrī Gupta appears as the founder of the
dynasty. His name is always given first in the dynastic table.<sup>1</sup>
Moreover, we find in the Udayagiri Cave inscription, of the
year 106<sup>2</sup> the wording {%“Guptānvyācām nṛpasattamānāṃ rājye”%}
(in the reign of the family of the best of kings, belonging to
the Gupta lineage) which shows that all these kings belonged
to a family which was founded by the above Gupta; hence
they were called Guptas.<sup>3</sup>
<P>In Śrī Gupta {%‘Śrī’%} is an honorific term as in the case of other
Gupta emperors mentioned in the inscriptions.<sup>4</sup> Had the name
of the first king been ‘Śrī Gupta’, it would have been mention-
ed as Śrī Śrī Gupta<sup>5</sup> as we find in the case of the name of
Śrīmatī in the Deo-Barnark Inscription of Jīvitagupta II.<sup>6</sup> If
we accept that Gupta was the name of the first king of the
family we may dismiss the possibility of the Gupta ending
signifying a surname.
<P>Now the question arises why the family was named after
this Gupta? In many cases families are named after some
important person born therein, and when once a family is so
named, the tradition is maintained even though the successors
may reach much higher positions. Prior to this the family
might not have attained any significant status. For the first
time this Gupta got the status of a Mahārāja as is mentioned
[Page-015+ 39]
in the Gupta inscriptions,<sup>7</sup> the status remained unchanged in
the second generation, and from the third generation the Gupta
kings became Mahārājādhirājas. Literally, Mahārāja means a
great king. But the apparent and deliberate differentiation in
the status of the earlier and later kings suggests that the poli-
tical status of this Gupta was not much high in his own times.<sup>8</sup>
Probably he was only a feudal chief and not an independent
king.
<P>The name Gupta is so short that it looks suspiciously queer.
But we must point out that the first part has not been lost or
damaged in the inscription. Palaeographically it is quite
categorical that the name is Gupta, there is no loss or damage
of syllables.
<P>In ordinary life in all societies we find the convenient
tendency to drop one part of the name. We address a person
by the {%pūrvapada%} or the {%uttarapada%} whichever is convenient to
us. By the passage of time that name becomes his popular
name. In some cases even his original name may be forgotten.
In our own case {%Gupta%} may have been the {%uttarapada%} of the
name of the first king by which he may have been generally
known. The name Gupta was probably very popular, so much
so that the dynasty itself was named after it.
<P>The practice of shortening the names is not known in the
Vedic times; it is noticed by Pāṇini and seems to have been
fashionable in the times of Katyāyana and Patañjali.<sup>9</sup> Several
examples of it are also met with in the Buddhist literature.
<P>In modern historical usage Śrī has become so much asso-
ciated with the name of the first king of the Gupta dynasty
that it has become a real part of his name generally written as
‘Śrī Gupta’.
<P>The psychology behind it may be that the use of the
smaller names sounds queer and it is brought at par with
other names in the dynasty, e.g. Candragupta, Samudragupta,
Kumāragupta, etc.
<P>V.A. Smith<sup>10</sup> suggests that this name was not simply Gupta,
but Śrīgupta, implying thereby that Śrī is an integral part of
his name, not the honorific prefix. Fleet<sup>11</sup> has thoroughly
refuted all his arguments and we may not discuss them here.
<P>Some corroborative evidence for the historicity of Śrī
[Page-016+ 39]
Gupta is afforded by two seals of which one is in Prakrit and
gives the legend {%‘Gautasya’%} while the other is in Sanskrit and
has the reading {%‘Śrī Guptasya’.%} It is most probable that these
seals belong to the founder of the Gupta dynasty, especially
the Sanskrit Seal.<sup>12</sup>
<P>The dynastic name is derived from the termination Gupta
of each king's personal name, showing that the line had no
respectable origin as clan, tribe, or caste.<sup>13</sup>
<P>The word ‘Gupta’ is derived from § gup to protect.<sup>14</sup> The
Viṣṇu Purāṇa<sup>15</sup> says — “(The termination) {%śarman%} is prescribed
for a brāhmaṇa; {%varman%} belongs to a kṣatriya; (and) a name
characterised by {%gupta%} and {%dāsa%} is approved of in the case of
(respectively) a vaiśya and a sūdra”. The commentary in the
Bombay edition gives as examples, Somaśarman, Indravarman,
Candragupta, and Sivadāsa.<sup>16</sup> The Mānavadharmaśāstra<sup>17</sup>
also lays down a similar rule without specifying the termina-
tions. On the basis of these authorities, it has been suggested
that the Early Guptas were not of a high caste, being at best
vaiśyas, and hence felt pride in their matrimonial alliance with
the Licchavis.<sup>18</sup>
<P>But we find that the rules regarding the naming of persons
prescribed in the Dharmaśāstras were not always strictly
followed. To give only a few examples the name of the well
known astronomer, Brahmagupta, a brāhmaṇa, ended in
‘Gupta’<sup>19</sup> and likewise Dāsavarman is the name of a brāhmaṇa,
in line 36 of the Nerur grant of Vijayāditya (dated Śaka-saṃvat
627).<sup>20</sup>
<P>We know of the names of the kings ending in Gupta as
early as second century B.C. from the records of the excava-
tions and explorations conducted in Central India.<sup>21</sup> It may
be noted from Tālagund stone pillar inscription of the time of
Śāntivarman (A.D. 455-70)<sup>22</sup> that the grandson of a brāh-
maṇa king Mayūraśarman was named as Kāku(ut)sthavarman.
Thus on consideration no weightage can be given to the word
{%‘gupta’%} denoting a Vaiśya class.
<P>In this context we must note that Prabhāvatīguptā, the
daughter of Candragupta II and chief queen of the Vākāṭaka
king Rudrasena II describes herself as belonging to the
Dhāraṇa {%gotra%} in her Poona and Rithpur copper plate inscrip-
[Page-017+ 39]
tions.<sup>23</sup> Dhāraṇa is clearly the {%gotra%} of her father, as the {%gotra%}
of her husband is specifically mentioned as ‘Viṣṇuvṛddha’ in
the Chammak copper plate inscription of Pravarasena II.<sup>24</sup>
<P>This Dhāraṇa {%gotra%} has been variously interpreted by
scholars.
<P>Jayaswal takes it to stand for {%Dhanri,%} a Jāṭ clan found in
Amritsar, and on the basis of the Kaumudīmahotsava he
concludes that Candragupta I was a {%Kāraskara%} or {%Kakkar jāṭ.%}<sup>25</sup>
This view has been supported by Gokhale.<sup>26</sup>
<P>Jayaswal emphasizes the similarity between the name of the
{%Dhāraṇīya jāṭs%} in Gaṅgānagar district of Rajasthan and the
Dhāraṇa {%gotra%} of the Guptas.<sup>27</sup> Candragomin's grammatical
illustration {%“ajayat jarto Hūṇān”%} (The {%jarta%} or Jāṭ king defeated
the Hūṇas) has also been interpreted by Jayaswal to refer to
the Gupta ruler Skandagupta's victory over the Hūṇas.<sup>28</sup> Thus
the jāṭ origin of the Guptas has been a favourite thesis of
Jayaswal.
<P>According to Raychaudhuri the Dhāraṇa {%gotra%} of the
Guptas suggests that they were related to Dhāriṇī, the chief
queen of Agnimitra Śuṅga.<sup>29</sup> This view is untenable. The
similarity in the two names is not sufficient to establish the
origin of the Dhārṇa {%gotra.%}
<P>On the basis of the evidence of the Skandapurāṇa Dashrath
Sharma<sup>30</sup> says that Dhāraṇa was a {%gotra%} of the brāhmaṇas of
Dharmāraṇya, a tract in the present Mirzapur district of
Eastern Uttar Pradesh. But Sharma is not ready to accept
that the Guptas were brāhmaṇas, he considers them to be
either kṣatriyas or vaiśyas who adopted the {%gotra%} of their
{%gurus,%} as sanctioned by the laws of the Smṛtis and the
Dharmasūtras.<sup>31</sup>
<P>But Goyal<sup>32</sup> considers the Guptas to be brāhmaṇas. He
relies on the evidence of their matrimonial alliances:
<P>We find that Prabhāvatīguptā, the daughter of Candragupta
II was married to the brāhmaṇa king Rudrasena II.<sup>33</sup> Kadamba
king Kāku(ut)sthavarman who was a brāhmaṇa says that he
married one of his daughters to a Gupta king.<sup>34</sup> Buddhist
scholar Paramārtha (A.D. 600) says that Bālāditya, the Gupta
king, married his sister to Vasurāta, a brāhmaṇa by caste.<sup>35</sup>
According to the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman
[Page-018+ 39]
Bhānuguptā (most probably a daughter of the Gupta king
Bhānugupta) was the 'wife of a certain Ravikīrtti, evidently a
brāhmaṇa, who was the grandfather of Dharmadosha, the
minister of Yaśodharman.<sup>36</sup>
<P>Thus, we see that three of the Gupta princesses were married
to brāhmaṇas.<sup>37</sup> There is only one instance of the Guptas
marrying a daughter of a Kadamba king, who was a
brāhmaṇa.<sup>38</sup>
<P>It is to be noted that matrimonial alliances played a signifi-
cant part in the foreign policy of the Guptas. Candragupta I
rose to power by marrying the Licchavi princess Kumāradevī
and Samudragupta accepted the offers of daughters from his
feudatories. Thus, marriages with the most powerful and dis-
tinguished royal families in different parts of India continued
to be an important policy of the Guptas.<sup>39</sup>
<P>Hence, the matrimonial alliances of the Guptas seem to
have sprung from political considerations.<sup>40</sup> Politically the
Kadambas were no match for the Guptas. It may be inferred
that it was on account of political pressures or as a matter of
pride for the Kadambas that they had married their daughter
to the Gupta king. We can explain all the matrimonial allian-
ces of the Guptas even without bringing political reasons in the
picture. As we know, intercaste marriages, especially of the
{%anuloma%} type, have been permitted by the Smṛtis. In three out
of the four cases Gupta princesses were married to brāhmaṇa
bridegrooms. If these are taken to have been {%anuloma%}
marriages Guptas could have belonged to any of the remaining
three {%varṇas.%} It is only the marriage of a Kadamba princess
with a Gupta king which requires the Guptas to have been
brāhmaṇas, otherwise it will be a case of a {%pratiloma%} marriage.
<P>The Guptas do not mention their caste in any of their
records. Had they been brāhmaṇas they must have been proud to
refer to it, especially because they were staunch supporters of
Hinduism. We find a parallel in the case of Pāla kings of
Bengal who are silent about their caste since they were
Buddhists.
<P>Finally Candragupta I agreed to have a joint coinage with
the Licchavis after his marriage with the Licchavi princess
Kumāradevī. Had the Gupta kings been brāhmaṇas, they
[Page-019+ 38]
would not have agreed to have a joint coinage (bearing the
legend {%‘Licchavayaḥ’,%} the Licchavis) with the Licchavis who
were {%Vrātya%} kṣatriyas.<sup>41</sup> Even if the Guptas had agreed for a
joint coinage as a political matter, they might have objected
the word {%‘Licchavayaḥ’%} on the coins. More astonishing is the
fact that even the name of the Guptas is not linked with the
legend {%‘Licchavayaḥ’.%} Above that, Samudragupta was ready to
be called {%Licchavi-dauhitra%} and seems to have mentioned this
epithet in his records as a matter of pride.<sup>42</sup> It may also be
noted that Prabhāvatīguptā though married to a brāhmaṇa
king Rudrasena II, was the daughter of Candragupta II born
of the union with a Nāga princess Kuberanāgā.<sup>43</sup>
<P>If Guptas could do such acts out of political expediency, we
do not admit them to be orthodox brāhmaṇas and are not ready
to give any weightage to their matrimonial alliances as Goyal
has done for the consideration of their caste. They were kings,
for them all such matters were first political and then social.<sup>44</sup>
Kosambi also ascribes to a similar view by stating that the
Guptas followed a series of political marriages ignoring tribal
or caste norms.<sup>45</sup>
<P>Thus we can conclude that the question of the caste of the
Guptas cannot be said to have been finally settled. If their
dhāraṇa {%gotra%} was not borrowed from the {%gotra%} of their
{%purohita%} and it originally belonged to them then they must be
described as brāhmaṇas. We will have to wait for some more
weighty and specific evidence to give the final verdict.

The inscriptions name Mahārājā Ghaṭotkaca as the successor
of Gupta. He should not be confused with Ghaṭotkacagupta
whose name occurs on some seals found at Vaīśālī, and also
in the Tumain Inscription of Kumāragupta and Ghaṭotkaca-
gupta (G. E. 116).<sup>46</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ghaṭotkaca was the name of a son of Bhīma-sena by the
Rākṣasī Hiḍimbā.<sup>47</sup> Names based on {%Ghaṭa%} are very rare in
Sanskrit literature. Thus Gaṇeśa is named Ghaṭodara ‘pot-
bellied’.<sup>48</sup> The name Ghaṭotkaca refers to the practice of
bearing traditional names based on Epics and Purāṇas. Deriva-
tively it means a person having a hairless head.<sup>49</sup> In Prācīna
Caritrakośa it has been suggested that Ghaṭotkaca was so
called as his head was like a {%ghaṭa%} (pitcher) and was hairless.<sup>50</sup>
Tripathi suggests on the basis of the Skanda Purāṇa that
Ghaṭotkaca was so called as he produced a loud voice while
laughing which may be compared to the voice produced by
thumping the pitcher quite aloud at its mouth by hands.<sup>51</sup> But
[Page-021+ 39]
the first derivation seems to be more plausible from linguistic
point of view<sup>52</sup> while the other explanation may be more
important from socio-psychological or mythological point of
view.
<div n="P"/>It is possible that it was the nickname of Ghaṭotkaca which
might have become his famous name.

While his two predecessors are each given the title of
{%Mahārāja,%} Candragupta I is described in the inscriptions as
{%Mahārājādhirāja,%} ‘king of kings’. Mookerjee connects the passage
from the Purāṇas defining the extent of the Gupta territory
with the period before Samudragupta, i.e., under Candragupta
I.<sup>53</sup> It has been suggested that Caṇḍasena of the play ‘Kaumudī-
Mahotsava’ is to be identified with Candragupta I. The
Licchavi alliance is the common point in the account given by
the drama and the inscriptions.<sup>54</sup> Other details of the drama,
however, do not support this identification. The drama
condemns Caṇḍasena as an usurper and belonging to low caste
whom the citizens of Magadha could not tolerate and drove out
to die in exile. Linguistically also Caṇḍasena and Candragupta
are different names. Candra can become Caṇḍa in Prakrit but
Gupta cannot be transformed into Sena. Moreover, in the fifth
act of the play we are informed through a character Lokākṣī
that the cursed Caṇḍasena has been killed and his royal family
uprooted.<sup>55</sup> Thus we know about the total annihilation of the
dynasty after the death of Caṇḍasena which is not applicable
to the dynasty of Caṇḍragupta which ruled for several genera-
tions after him.<sup>56</sup> The name of the deity {%Candra%} ‘moon’ has
been given to this king; Gupta is the surname. It may refer
to his handsome physical features.

was the daughter's son of the Licchavis, and son of {%Mahārājā-%}

{%dhirāja%} Śrī Candragupta I born on the queen Kumāradevī.<sup>58</sup>
He has been mentioned as a {%‘Paramabhāgavata’%} (a devout
devotee of Lord Viṣṇu).<sup>59</sup> No. 2, L. 10 gives the justification
of his name Samudragupta.<sup>60</sup> Mookerji says that the name
Samudragupta was probably a title assumed after his conquests.
It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion
which extended upto the sea. The Mathurā Inscription of
Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as
extending up to the four oceans ({%caturudadhisalilāsvāditaya-%}
{%śasaḥ%}). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts,
Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his
surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his
coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’
while the reverse has {%‘Parākramaḥ’%} as his title. The name
‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such
as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.<sup>61</sup> Mookerji<sup>62</sup> holds that
Samudragupta's personal name was Kāca and that Samudra-
gupta was his title. But the identification of Kāca with
Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.<sup>63</sup> Vāmana
in his Kāvyalaṃkāra<sup>64</sup> refers to Candraprakāśa as the son of
Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of
Samudragupta.<sup>65</sup> But it seems to be the name of a local king of
Ayodhyā rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta
dynasty.<sup>66</sup> Another probable and most suitable explanation
of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord Śiva’,
Samudra being an epithet of Śiva.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of
these are also supported by numismatic evidence.<sup>68</sup>

In No. 42, he is mentioned as the son of Candragupta II. His
mother's name was Dhruvasvāminī. No. 32 explains the basis
of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta,
produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who
was as famous as Govinda (Viṣṇu) for the glory of his virtues,
and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons
and gods.”<sup>77</sup> The poet means that Govindagupta resembled
demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual
virtues.
<div n="P"/>Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his
father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kumāra-
gupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years,
the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II
(G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kumāragupta I (G.E.
96).<sup>78</sup> P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between
A.D. 412 and 415.<sup>79</sup> That Govindagupta could have ruled as
emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the
fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta
does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of
Kumāragupta and his successors.<sup>80</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is also likely that Kumāragupta defeated or ousted
Govindagupta and seized the throne; and after his accession,
avoided all references to his elder brother.<sup>81</sup>

monastic establishments at that place were enriched by the
successive endowments of Śakrāditya, Budhagupta, Tathāgata-

been suggested that Budhagupta was the son of Kumāragupta I
who had the title of {%Mahendrāditya%} (Mahendra = Śakra).<sup>99</sup>
In view of the clear epigraphic reference to the parentage of
Budhagupta the proposed identification must be rejected.<sup>100</sup>
The statement of Hiuen Tsang was based on hearsay and not

quite a prominent place in the time of Budhagupta. But in view

Vainya is the synonym for the first king ‘Pṛthu’.<sup>109</sup> Hiranand
Shastri mentions Vainya as a synonym of Kubera, the god of
wealth. According to Sir Richard Burn {%Vainya%} was another
name of {%Vajra%} whom Hiuen Tsang mentions as the son of
Bālāditya. He chiefly relies on the St. Petersburg dictionary
where Vainya is derived from Vena and is connected with
Indra; {%Vajra%} is the thunderbolt and {%Vainya%} is a patronymic
from Vena who is Indra.<sup>110</sup> But the suggested identification is
extremely far-fetched. {%Vajra%} cannot by any stretch of imagina-
tion be described as a synonym of {%Vainya.%} Moreover, it is diffi-
cult to believe that Hiuen Tsang would have referred to the
king by such a name in preference of the real name.
<div n="P"/>In No. 51 Vainyagupta is mentioned as a {%paramabhāgavata%}
and {%mahārājādhirāja,%} but in No. 53 he is described as a devotee
of Lord Śiva ({%bhagavān mahādevapādānudhyāta%}) and a {%mahārāja%}
only. Some scholars hold the opinion that it shall be wrong to
disconnect Vainyagupta from the Gupta family on the basis of
the argument that the Guptas were Vaiṣṇavas while Vainya-
gupta professed to be a Śaiva.<sup>111</sup> We find both the epithets
{%‘paramabhāgavata’%} and {%‘mahādevapādānudhyāta’%} for him in our
records.
<div n="P"/>It is interesting that even his Pādadāsa and Uparika are
styled as mahārājas (LL. 3 and 16). His title Mahārāja, there-
fore, cannot prove that Vainyagupta was an insignificant
prince.<sup>112</sup>
<div n="P"/>The legend on No. 51, though partially preserved, resembles
in point of style the legend on the other seals of the Imperial
Guptas. Here Vainyagupta is specifically called {%paramabhāgavata.%}
Moreover, his name, like those of other kings in the Gupta
dynasty ends in the word Gupta. It is thus clear that Vainya-
gupta belonged to the line of the Imperial Guptas. He seems
to have ruled in any case over considerable parts of Bengal and
Bihar<sup>113</sup> almost immediately after Budhagupta. We do not
know anything about the relationship of Vainyagupta with
Budhagupta and Bhānugupta of the Eraṇ Inscription of A.D.
510.<sup>114</sup> Some scholars assign him a reign of four years before
Bhānugupta (A.D. 510).<sup>115</sup>
<div n="P"/>The regnal period of Vainyagupta witnessed a considerable
decline in the power and prestige of the Imperial Guptas. The
[Page-029+ 38]
rise of the ruling dynasty consisting of Dharmāditya, Gopa-
candra and Samācāradeva in Central and South-West Bengal
in the first half of the sixth Century A.D., possibly points to
the extirpation of Gupta rule from Bengal excepting the
bhukti (province) of Puṇḍravardhana (North Bengal).<sup>116</sup>

sor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have
included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have
been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its
western part was being ruled by Bhānugupta. Third, Bhānu-
gupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like
Govindagupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta. It is possible that he be-
longed to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded
Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively
over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to
determine. The latter view seems more probable and this in-
ternal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the
empire.<sup>117</sup> Bhānugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to
his bravery in Eraṇ Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and

1. {%Kumāradevī:%}¦ (No. 1, L. 29; No. 4, L. 8; No. 10, L. 4;
[Page-030+ 39]
No. 12, L. 18; No. 13, L. 3; No. 21, LL. 5-6; No. 40,
L. 4; No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 49. L. 2; No. 50,

She was the wife of Candragupta I and the mother of Samudra-
gupta. Kumāra, the basis of her name has already been ex-
plained under Kumāragupta.

2. {%Dattadevī%}¦ (No. 4, L. 10; No. 10, L. 5; No. 12, L. 20;
No. 13, L. 4; No. 47, L. 3; No. 53, L. 3; No. 49, L. 3;
No. 50, L. 3):
She is mentioned as the wife of Samudragupta and the mother
of Candragupta II. {%Datta%} means ‘given’ or protected.<sup>119</sup> We
also find {%‘Datta’%} as the name-ending suffix for male names in
literature.
<div n="P"/>3 (a) {%Dhruvadevī%} (No. 53, L. 5; No. 12, L. 21; No. 13, L. 5;
No. 49, L. 4; No. 50, L. 4; No. 47, L. 5):
She was the mother of Kumāragupta I and the wife of Candra-
gupta II. Literally {%‘Dhruva’%} means unchangeable or constant.
It is also the name of the polar star (personified as son of
Uttāna-pāda and grandson of Manu).<sup>120</sup>
<div n="P"/>3 (b). {%Dhruvasvāminī%} (No. 42, LL. 3-4):
We come to know of Dhruvasvāminī only in No. 42. Lines 1-3
mention her as the wife of Candragupta II and the mother of
Govindagupta. As we have noticed Dhruvadevī elsewhere
appears as the wife of Candragupta II and mother of Kumāra-
gupta I. It is not much likely that Candragupta II had two
queens with almost identical names. As the real name of the
two is the same (Dhruva) it would be better to hold that
Dhruvasvāminī was another name of Dhruvadevī and Kumāra-
gupta I and Govindagupta were real brothers.

4. {%Anantadevī%}¦ (No. 49, L. 5; No. 50, L. 5; No. 53, L. 6;
No. 47, L. 6):
She is mentioned as the wife of Kumāragupta I and the mother
of Pūrugupta. According to Monier Williams {%Ananta%} is the
name alike of Viṣṇu, Śeṣa (The Snake-god), Śeṣa's brother
Vāsuki; Kṛṣṇa, his brother Baladeva, Śiva and Rudra; and is
also included in the list of the Viśve-devas and the Arhats, etc.

5. {%Candradevī<sup>121</sup>%}¦ (No. 47, L. 7; No. 53, L. 7):
The name of the mother of Budhagupta occurring at the be-
ginning of the extant portion of line 7 is not clearly legible; it
[Page-031+ 39]
consists of four letters, the first of which is either {%ca%} or {%va%} and
the second is certainly {%n%} with some subscript mark or letter;
the third and fourth letters clearly read {%devyām.%} It is, therefore,
highly probable that her name was Candradevī, known from
some seals to have been the name of the queen of Pūrugupta.
Hiranand Shastri takes the relevant legend to be {%‘Śrīvainya-%}
{%devyām’%}<sup>122</sup> but regards the correct reading to be {%Candra%} in place
of {%Vainya.%}<sup>123</sup>
<div n="P"/>No. 47 mentions Candradevī as the name of the mother of
Narasiṃhagupta.
<div n="P"/>In No. 53 Candradevī is mentioned as the mother of Budha-
gupta and wife of Pūrugupta.
<div n="P"/>The name Candradevī is based on the god Candra (Moon).

6. {%Śrīva(tsa)devī%}¦<sup>124</sup> (No. 49, L. 6; No. 50, L. 6):
{%‘Śrīva’%} is clearly legible but the terminal {%‘tsa’%} can only faintly
be seen.
<div n="P"/>She is mentioned as the wife of Pūrugupta and mother of
Narasiṃhagupta. ‘Śrīvatsa’ is the name of Viṣṇu, which literally
means ‘beloved or favourite of Śrī’ (Lakṣmī).<sup>125</sup> It is also a
symbol or mark of Viṣṇu.<sup>126</sup>

<L>23<pc>031<k1>मित्रदेवी<k2>मित्रदेवी
7. {%Mitradevī%}¦ (No. 49, LL. 7-8; No. 50, L. 7):
No. 49 mentions {%mahādevī%} Sumatidevī as the wife of Narasiṃha-
gupta and mother of Kumāragupta III. Fleet read the name
as Mahālakṣmīdevī<sup>127</sup> and Hoernle as ‘Śrīmatīdevī’.<sup>128</sup> But in
No. 50 the reading is clearly ‘Mitradevī’.<sup>129</sup> Mitra is one of the
several names of the Solar deity.

<P>37. These three marriages are not of much importance as a {%brāhmaṇa%}
can marry in any caste according to the injunctions of the Smṛtis. So even
being of lower class than brāhmaṇas, Guptas could have married their
daughters to the brāhmaṇas.
<P>38. R.C. Majumdar, Pg. p. 170; It has been suggested that Candra-
gupta II arranged a marriage between his son and the daughter of Kāku
(t) stha Varman, the most powerful ruler of the Kadamba family who
was the ruler of Kuntala, Kanarese country in the Bombay Presidency.
<P>39. Cf. Ibid., p. 170.
<P>40. Ibid., p. 169.
<P>41. Ibid., p. 128.
<P>42. Majumdar says that ‘we may reasonably assume that the marriage
of Candragupta and Kumāradevī led to the amalgamation of the Gupta
principality with the Licchavī State, and the epithet {%licchavi-dauhitra%} was
deliberately given to Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession
to the dual monarchy’.
R.C. Majumdar, Pg. 129.
<P>Cf. V.S. Pathak, TJ, XIX. Pt. II, pp. 140-41: Pathak takes the meaning
of dauhitra in the technical sense of the Smṛtis, i.e., “a person having
dual parentage ({%dvāmuṣyāyaṇa%})”.

enjoy more lust, but every one declined except the youngest Pūru who
declared his willingness. Pūru left his youth for Yayāti. After enjoying
the pleasures of youth for another thousand years Yayāti still felt dis-
satisfied. At last he took up the burden of his old age and returned his son
Pūru his youth. He installed Puru on the throne and retired to the forest.

<L>24<pc>038<k1>गणपति<k2>गणपति
1. {%Gaṇapati%}¦ (No. 1, L. 13):
One of the kings said to have been uprooted by Samudragupta
in northern India. The name violates the laws laid down by
the Gṛhya-sūtras which prohibit the giving of the names of
deities to human-beings directly.<sup>1</sup>

Another king of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta. The
first part is Gaṇapati and the second is ‘nāga’, which signifies
that the king belonged to the Nāga dynasty. He probably
ruled at Mathurā.<sup>2</sup>

1. {%Candravarmman:%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta.
The first part is Candra and second is ‘Varmma’ which is a
form for the original term ‘varman’, a surname generally used
for kṣatriyas. He may be identified with the king of that name
whose record has been found at Susunia in Bankura district,
Bengal.<sup>3</sup>

He is described as the ruler of the country that lies between the
rivers Kālindī and Narmadā, and governing with the qualities
of a regent lording, one of the quarters of the world, and en-
joying the title of a mahārāja during the reign of Budhagupta.

1. {%Nāgadatta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta.
The first part is Nāga which refers most likely to ‘a holy ser-
pent’ and the second is ‘datta’ meaning given. Thus the full
name may mean ‘born by the grace of a Nāga’. D.C. Sircar
takes the compound as a Caturthī Tatpuruṣa instance mean-
ing ‘dedicated to a Nāga’. However, the compounds are usually
taken as Tṛtīyā Tatpuruṣa instances. The names do not indi-
cate towards bali but such names as Gurudatta, Śivadatta and
Nāgadatta may exhibit reverence to Guru, Śiva or Nāga by
whose worship or blessings the son was born which is attested
to by tradition of such names.

2. {%Nāgasena%}¦ (No. 1, L. 13, 21):
The first part of the name is Nāga and the second is sena.
Nāgasena of the L. 13 and L. 21 looks to be the same.<sup>4</sup> Accord-
ing to L. 21 he was one of the kings of Āryyāvartta uprooted
by Samudragupta. In L. 13 he is mentioned as having been
defeated by Samudragupta by the valour of his arms. He
seems to have been an important king.<sup>5</sup>

1. {%Rudradatta%}¦ (No. 52, L. 3):
He is given the designation of a {%mahārāja%} and is mentioned as
a {%pādadāsa%} (slave of the feet) of Vainyagupta. The first part
literally meaning roaring, dreadful or terrible<sup>6</sup> denotes Śiva and
the second ‘given’; the full name meaning ‘given by Lord Śiva’.

<L>31<pc>039<k1>रुद्रदेव<k2>रुद्रदेव
2. {%Rudradeva%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
He is described as one of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by
Samudragupta. The first part of the name is Rudra which
denotes Lord Śiva and the second is ‘deva’ which means ‘god’.
It is another name based on Lord Śiva. Rudradeva has been
differently identified by various scholars. Dr. D.C. Sircar has
identified him with the Western Satrap Rudrasena II or his
son Rudrasena III, while K.P. Jayaswal, K.N. Dikshit and
R.N. Dandekar identify him with Vākāṭaka Rudrasena I.
U.N. Roy<sup>7</sup> differing with the above scholars proposes his
[Page-040+ 37]
identification with Vākāṭaka Mahārāja Rudrasena II, the son
of Pṛthviṣeṇa I.

He is mentioned as a ruler of Pālakka during the reign of
Samudragupta. Ugra meaning ‘powerful mighty or terrible’, is
another name of Rudra or Śiva.<sup>8</sup> Sena is merely a surname.
Or we can give another explanation of the whole as {%Ugrā senā%}
{%asya,%} i.e. ‘having mighty army’.

<L>33<pc>040<k1>प्रभाकर<k2>प्रभाकर
1. {%Prabhākara%}¦ (No. 32, L. 8):
He is described as a king (bhūmipati) and a destroyer of the
enemies of the Gupta dynasty. He was the overlord of Datta-
bhaṭa. He is not known from any other source. The name of his
capital or territory is not mentioned. Probably he was the con-
temporary local chief of Daśapura and a feudatory ally of the
Guptas in their struggle against the Hūṇas.<sup>9</sup> Dattabhaṭa does
not include in the inscription the genealogy of his master. It is
possible that Prabhākara was a self-made man who did not
have a distinguished ancestor worthy of record. He may have
been appointed as a ruler of Daśapura by the paramount
power, after the extinction of the Varman dynasty.<sup>10</sup> That
Prabhākara was not a scion of the Varman dynasty would also
appear from his name which, unlike the names of the known
members of that dynasty, does not end in Varman.<sup>11</sup> The
name violates the laws of Gṛhyasūtras which forbid the direct
imposition of the names of deities upon human-beings.

<L>34<pc>040<k1>अच्युतनन्दिन्<k2>अच्युतनन्दिन्
1. {%Acyutanandin%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
He is included in the list of kings of Āryyāvartta forcefully
uprooted by Samudragupta. Acyuta is the name of Viṣṇu or
Kṛṣṇa,<sup>12</sup> and Nandin is the name of an attendant of Śiva and
also the name of Śiva's bull.<sup>13</sup> So literally the expression would
mean ‘one who is a servant of god Visṇu’. Nandin also means
gladdening or rejoicing.<sup>14</sup> So it may also mean ‘one who
pleases or wins over god Viṣṇu’.
<div n="P"/>Acyutanandin seems to have been a ruler of Ahicchatra
[Page-041+ 39]
(near Bareilly district).<sup>15</sup> The Purāṇas give names ending in
‘Nandin’ in the list of Nāga kings and coins bearing ‘Acyuta’
have been found from Ahicchatra.<sup>16</sup> Therefore, it is possible
that Ahicchatra was a seat of government of Acyutanandin.

2. {%Dhanyaviṣṇu%}¦ (No. 18, L. 8):
He was the grandson of mahārāja Indraviṣṇu and younger
brother of mahārāja Mātṛviṣṇu. We also find his name in line
5 of the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa
(A.D. 500-515).<sup>17</sup> It signifies the tendency of naming persons
by using adjectives before the names of deities. Dhanya means
‘bringing or bestowing wealth or the opulent’.<sup>18</sup>

Mātṛviṣṇu; a brāhmaṇa devoted to studies and celebrating
sacrifices and belonging to Maitrāyaṇīya (śākhā). The vedic
counterpart is Indrāviṣṇū m. dual.

5. {%Matṛviṣṇu:%}¦ (No. 18, L. 7):
He was the installer of the stone pillar at Eraṇ, a mahārāja,
grandson of mahārāja Indraviṣṇu. We also find his name in
the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa
(A.D. 500-515).<sup>20</sup> Mātṛ stands for one of the seven Mātṛ-
kās<sup>21</sup> and may refer to the prevalence of the Mātṛ cult. The
name is formed by the similar process of the combination of
the names of two deities, Mātṛ and Viṣṇu. Mātṛ if taken as a
short form for the Vedic Mātariśvan, together with Viṣṇu
would mean Agni and Viṣṇu an interpretation that is relevant
to the context.

Viṣṇu’.

He is mentioned as a ruler of Surāṣṭra appointed by Skanda-
gupta. He was the father of governor Cakrapālita. Sankalia
considers it to be an Iranian name.<sup>23</sup> But it can can very well
be an Indian name. Parṇa means a leaf and is as well the name
of a tree called Palāśa. We find ‘Parṇadatta’ to be the name
of a man in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<sup>24</sup> It signifies ‘a person
born as a result of the worship of the Parṇa (Palāśa) tree’.

who had developed great power and wealth were defeated by
king Skandagupta.
<div n="P"/>The other readings suggested by scholars are Puṣpamitra
and Yudhyamitra. But a careful scrutiny will support the
reading Puṣyamitra as more likely. In the passages quoted by
Bühler from the Prakrit Gāthās, ascribed to Merutuṅga,
Dharmasāgara and Jayavijayāgni<sup>29</sup>, the name of the early
king Puṣyamitra, the contemporary of Patañjali appears as
Pusamitta and thus supports the reading Puṣyamitra.

Puṣyamitra. Puṣyamitra, the name of a tribe in Central India,
is also mentioned in the Purāṇas.

takes it as another name of Candragupta II.<sup>32</sup> The view

King of Kurūḷa, one of the rulers of Dakṣṇāpatha defeated

<div n="P"/>In this name the first part is Maṇṭa and the second is Rāja.
The meaning of the first part is not clear. It is clearly not a

Sanskrit word. As Woolner has pointed out words with cereb-
rals are often non-Āryan or influenced by non-Āryan elements.<sup>35</sup>
Another possibility is that these names show dialectal elements.
Even now-a-days we give names like Maṇṭu, Baṇṭu, etc., to
little children. There is also a possibility that the Sanskrit
word ‘mantra’ meaning ‘a hymn or magical formula’ got
changed to ‘maṇṭa’ through a process of Prakritization, or
we may derive it from an artificial root ‘maṇṭ’ to act as
intermediator.<sup>36</sup>

He was the ruler of Mahākāntāra and was one of the kings of

fied with the Vākāṭaka feudatory prince Vyāghra whose inscrip-
tions have been found at Nach-ne-ki-talai and Ganj in Central
India, who is also said to have been the ruler of the Ucchakalpa
dynasty in Bundelkhand.<sup>39</sup> But an objection to this view is
that he must be a ruler in Dakṣiṇāpatha as mentioned in our
inscription and has accordingly been identified with the ruler
of Mahā-vana, a synonym of Mahā-kāntāra, also called Jeypore
forest in Orissa.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name is based on the animal {%Vyāghra,%} or tiger imply-
ing that in Mahākāntāra his subordinate chiefs were like tigers

Bandhuvarmman was the son of Viśvavarman. He was probably
a feudatory chief, ruling at Dasapura, Mandasor in Western
Malwa,<sup>41</sup> in the time of Kumāragupta I. He has been men-
tioned as a king (nṛpa) governing the city of Daśapura and
it was under his rulership that the Sun-temple was caused to
be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Mandasor (Daśa-
pura). The relevant lines in the inscription lay a stress on his
name Bandhu. He is described as possessed of firmness and
statesmanship; beloved of (his) kinsmen; the relative, as it were,
of (his) subjects; the remover of the afflictions of (his) con-
nections; pre-eminently skilful in destroying the ranks of (his)
proud enemies.<sup>42</sup> Varman is a kṣatriya surname meaning

{%ṭapākika,<sup>58</sup>%} a {%Sāndhivigrahika,%} a {%Kumārāmātya%} and a {%Mahāda-%}
{%ṇḍanāyaka%} of Samudragupta. He is also the composer of this
inscription which has been termed as a {%kāvya.<sup>59</sup>%}
<div n="P"/>Hari is Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa and {%sena%} is to be obtained from
Sanskrit senā. The name can be explained in two ways.
That Hari is his personal name and ṣeṇa or sena his surname.
We may also explain it is, ‘one with Hari as his army’. The
Mahābhārata informs us that there was only big army on the side
of the Kauarvas and there was only Hari, i.e., Lord Kṛṣṇa on
the side of the Pāṇḍavas. The Pāṇḍavas could get Hari on
their side by foregoing the Yādava army to the Kauravas.

Hailing from Pāṭaliputra he was Candragupta II's minister
for peace and war by hereditary right<sup>60</sup> and accompanied the
king on his far-reaching military expeditions. The first part is
Vīra which means ‘brave’ and the second is {%‘sena’,%} the whole
literally meaning ‘one with a brave army’. Pāṇini refers to
{%Senānta%} names in his Aṣṭādhyāyī.<sup>61</sup> We find many such
names as Vārisena, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa, Bhīmasena and Ugrasena.<sup>62</sup>
U.N. Roy conjectures the possibility of the composition
of the {%‘Praśasti’%} inscribed on the Meharauli Iron Pillar
Inscription by Śāba alias Vīrasena who was an accomplished
poet and a favourite minister of Candragupta II, Vikramā-
ditya.<sup>63</sup> It is possible that he outlived his patron and when
during a {%Dharmayātrā%} he revisited the spot where the lofty
banner had been raised as a mark of homage to Lord Viṣṇu
after the victory over the Vāhlikas, was moved to compose
and inscribe this {%Praśasti%} on the Meharauli Pillar.<sup>64</sup>

Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. The first part is
{%dhruva%} which means ‘firm’ or definite and the second part is

Governor of Surāṣṭra in the reign of Skandagupta who restored
the break in the Sudarśana lake and renewed the embankment.
<div n="P"/>It has been shown by Charpentier that he was an Iranian.<sup>70</sup>
We find many Iranians adopting names after Hindu gods.<sup>71</sup>
Cakrapālita means ‘one protected by the disc (bearer)’, i.e., a

The first part Cirāta can be a Prakritization of the word Kirāta
which is the name of Śiva (the god Śiva in the form of a wild
mountaineer or Kirāta as opposed to Arjuna).<sup>73</sup> Hence the

A {%kumārāmātya%} in the time of Vainyagupta. The first part is
Revajja and the second svāmin. Revajja can be derived from
{%revat%} which means rich or prosperous.<sup>80</sup> Thus the name would

D.C. Sircar takes the reading to be Gaṇḍaka which seems to
be correct.<sup>85</sup> One scholar<sup>86</sup> equates Śaṇḍaka with Saṇḍaka
which means a ‘bull’ and says that the word Gaṇḍaka yields
no sensible meaning. But Gaṇḍaka has been accepted as the
most probable reading by scholars.<sup>87</sup> Gaṇḍaka is the name of
a river in the northern part of India.<sup>88</sup> So the name Gaṇḍaka
based on the river Gaṇḍakī can be given to a person just as the
name Gaṅgā based on the river Ganges is given to a person.
Gaṇḍaka is also the name of the Videhas living on the river
Gaṇḍakī<sup>89</sup> and also refers to a rhinoceros.<sup>90</sup> It is possible
that the present name, like {%Vyāghra%} discussed elsewhere is
based on the name of an animal.

copper plate inscription of Bhānugupta. Literally the name
would mean ‘self-existent god’, i.e., Brahmā. As mentioned
earlier the practice of giving names of gods to human-beings
directly is against the tradition of the Dharmasūtras.

collateral branch of Mathurā family. He offered stubborn resistance to
Samudragupta but it proved of no avail. His kingdom was incorporated

name of the family-deity was added as the name-ending surname.

perity.<sup>58</sup> The second part is {%‘datta’.%} Thus the whole literally means
‘given by prosperity’. It may signify that the family became
prosperous just before his birth. We find many names based on
the word {%‘kṣema’%} in ancient Sanskrit literature.<sup>59</sup>

8. {%Piṅgala%}¦ (No. 29, L. 4):

<L>148<pc>064<k1>राम<k2>राम
9. {%Rāma%}¦ (No. 29, L. 6):
It is another one-word name. Here the name of Lord Rāma,
the Epic hero, has been given directly to a person against the
rules of the Smṛtis. We may suggest that in such cases either the
second part is dropped or is not given at all by the parents.
<LEND>

<L>149<pc>064<k1>रामक<k2>रामक
10. {%Rāmaka%}¦ (No. 29, L. 5):
It is also an abbreviated name possibly from Rāma-datta (Cf.
Pāṇini V. 3. 82) with the addition of the suffix {%‘ka’.%} In the Agni
Purāṇa it is the name of Rāma Rāghava.<sup>61</sup> It is formed from
[Page-065+ 38]
§ ram and means delighting, gratifying.<sup>62</sup> According to lexico-
graphers a Rāmaka is a Māgadha who lives as a messenger.<sup>63</sup>
But here it is a personal name based on the Epic hero Lord
Rāma.

meaning ‘an attendant of Lord Śiva’.
<LEND>

<L>151<pc>065<k1>सोमपाल<k2>सोमपाल
12. {%Somapāla%}¦ (No. 29, L. 6):
Soma is nectar (the beverage of the gods called {%Amṛta%}) and
{%pāla%} means ‘protector’. Thus the whole literally means ‘pro-
tector or guardian of Amṛta’. It is the name of several men in
the Rājataraṅgiṇī<sup>64</sup> and in plural it is the name of the Gan-
dharvas (as keeping especial guard over Soma).<sup>65</sup>

13. {%Śrībhadra%}¦ (No. 29, L. 6):
Śrī is the name of the goddess of wealth, the wife of Viṣṇu and
{%bhadra%} means ‘blessed’. Thus the whole literally means ‘blessed
by the goddess of wealth’.
<LEND>

<L>153<pc>065<k1>शुङ्कक<k2>शुङ्कक
14. {%Śuṅkaka%}¦ (No. 29, L. 4):
It is also an abbreviated name with the addition of suffix {%‘ka’.%}
The word should have been Śaṅkuka instead of Śuṅkaka.
The present form may be due to the mistake of the engraver.
The word Śuṅkaka is meaningless. Śaṅku is the name of Lord
Śiva. We have many names based on the word Śaṅku in lite-
rature. Śaṅkuka was the name of a poet (author of the
Bhuvanābhyudaya and son of Mayūra),<sup>66</sup> and also of a writer
on rhetoric.<sup>67</sup>

<L>154<pc>065<k1>वर्ग्गपाल<k2>वर्ग्गपाल
15. {%Varggapāla%}¦ (No. 29, L. 4):
The first part is {%Vargga%} which means ‘a separate division,
group, company, family, party’, literally meaning ‘one who
excludes or removes or averts’.<sup>68</sup> The second part is {%pāla%}
meaning protector, thus the whole means ‘protector of the
division, group or party’.

The lofty pillar (Inscription No. 10), ‘firm and excellent’ was

<div n="P"/>The first part of the name is {%‘Dhruva’%} the Polar star. Pāṇini

Ravila has been mentioned as the writer of the draft of the
Mandasor Stone Inscription of Mālava Saṃvat 524 (A.D. 467).<sup>73</sup>
It is a name ending in {%ila.%}<sup>74</sup> It seems to be an abbreviated form

He is the writer of the Dhanaidaha Copper Plate Inscription of

mean ‘one who is a devotee of Lord Śiva’.

The Mandasor Stone Inscription of Kumāragupta and Bandhu-
varman (the Mālava years 493 and 529) was composed by
Vatsabhaṭṭi.<sup>78</sup> Vatsa is often used as a term of endearment
(= my dear child).<sup>79</sup> Originally it was used for a calf, then for
the young of any animal and finally for any offspring or child.
The child or the young of any animal being lovely, it became
a term of endearment. The second part of the present name

of the name is Māra which is the name of the god of love who
in the Buddhist literature is described as the greatest enemy of
the Buddha and his religion.<sup>83</sup> The second part of the name is

of a poet.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is a name based on the Zodiacal sign Leo or its {%lagna.%}

Latter on {%Haliya Kaivarttas%} thinking themselves superior banned all in-
termarriage with {%Jaliya Kaivarttas%} and succeeded in getting recognition as
a separate caste under the name of {%Mahiṣya%} (Hutton, W. p. 46). According

Deva, the first part of the name, means ‘god, heavenly or
divine’. The second part is a name-ending suffix used for learned
brāhmaṇas. The ending Bhaṭṭa denoting a scholar later be-
came a surname just as the English word ‘Master’ is under-
going a change in usage with the Gujarati-speaking people and
the word ‘professor’ may soon have with the Marāṭhī-speaking
people.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>Devabhaṭṭa was a brāhmaṇa. He was an inhabitant of
Puṇḍravardhana. He belonged to Vājasaneyacaraṇa, and was

likely that in the present case it is the nick-name which has
been mentioned.

He was a brāhmaṇa belonging to the community of {%Caturvedins%}
of the locality known as Padmā in the city of Indrapura. He
has been mentioned as the great grand-father of the brāh-
maṇa Devaviṣṇu, the giver of an endowment for the maintenance
of a lamp in the temple of the god Sun.
<div n="P"/>It is an abbreviated name with the ending {%“ika”%}<sup>12</sup> like
Devika for Devadatta; Yajñika for Yajñadatta and Chadika
for Chandodatta.<sup>13</sup>
[Page-090+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The name ‘Ḍaḍḍa’, ‘Ḍuḍḍa’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍā’<sup>14</sup> cannot be
derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found
in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia
suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit
term Dardara,<sup>15</sup> meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having
holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly
region.
<div n="P"/>We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddara-
pabbata’ and ‘Mahādaddara’ in the Daddara Jātaka.<sup>16</sup> The
{%Daddarapabbata%} may be identified with the mountainous tract
of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south
of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the
Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pāṇini calls
the river {%Dāradī Sindhuḥ.%}<sup>17</sup>
<div n="P"/>The people of this tract, the {%Daradas%} are mentioned in the
Mahābhārata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up
along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and Śakas, from the cow
Kāmadhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by
Viśvāmitra from Vasiṣṭha's {%āśrama.<sup>18</sup>%} The Daradas are the
people, living above Peshawar.<sup>19</sup> But the basic weakness in the
suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia<sup>20</sup> is, as he himself
admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit
dictionary.
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the words Ḍoḍa and Ḍoḍḍa are syno-
nyms used for a brāhmaṇa and Ḍoḍiṇī stands for a brāhmaṇī,
or a brāhmaṇa-woman.<sup>21</sup> These are deśya words and hence
refer to local elements.
<div n="P"/>In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credu-
lous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘Ḍoḍa’. It is
not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish
approach a brāhmaṇa was generally taken to be a simple
person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical
brāhmaṇa is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped.
Hence it is possible that a brāhmaṇa was called ‘Ḍoḍa’ and
the feminine form of ‘Ḍoḍa’ (i. e. Ḍoḍiṇī) was used for a
brāhmaṇa-womaṇ.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>In Karnataka ‘Ḍoḍḍu’ means ‘big’ or elder. {%‘Ḍoḍḍācārya’%}
or {%‘Ḍuḍḍācārya’%} a term of respect for a learned Paṇḍita is also
used in satire.
[Page-091+ 37]
<div n="P"/>It is interesting to note that {%Ḍaḍḍa%} is also an English slang
word meaning ‘a foolish person’.

5. {%Haritrāta%}¦ (No. 16, L. 5):
The first part of the name is Hari, which means ‘God’ and is
also the name among others of Lord Viṣṇu and Kṛṣṇa. Gene-
rally Hari is derived from § {%hṛ’%} to take away or remove evil or
sin.<sup>23</sup> The second part {%‘trāta’%} means ‘protected’. Thus the
whole literally means ‘protected by Hari’.<sup>24</sup> Haritrāta was a
brāhmaṇa belonging to the community of the {%Catur-%}

Indrapura.

The name consisting of two parts {%‘abhaya’%} and {%‘mitra’%} can
mean a friend of unfearfulness or ‘an unfearful friend’. ‘Abhaya’
is also the name of Lord Śiva<sup>28</sup> and ‘mitra’ is a synonym for
the god Sun. Thus it may also be a name formed by combining
the names of two deities as in the case of Rāmakṛṣṇa. Abhaya-
mitra was the name of a Buddhist monk who caused a {%pratimā%}

The image on which the Mathurā Jaina Inscription of Kumāra-
gupta I, of G. E. 113 is inscribed was set up by Śāmāḍhyā (Śyāmā-
ḍhyā), the daughter of Bhaṭṭibhava. Bhaṭṭibhava seems to have
been a brāhmaṇa-follower of Jainism. Bhaṭṭa or Bhaṭṭi, a surname
meaning ‘a teacher’ has been put here before Bhava. Bhaṭṭi is
the Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘Bharti’ meaning a lord or
master which came to be accepted as a Sanskrit word. ‘Bhava’
means ‘a god, deity’ and is also the name of Lord Śiva.
Bhava also means ‘prosperity, welfare’.<sup>30</sup> Thus the full name
literally means ‘one who is a (source of) prosperity, for his
teacher’. It can also be a case of a name after the deity ‘Bhava’
or ‘Śiva’.

form. According to Monier Williams<sup>31</sup> ‘Dattila’ is one of the

Prahlāda and has been the king of the Asuras.<sup>58</sup> A famous
legend about him runs thus — The demon Bali, by his austeri-
ties acquired the dominion over the three worlds, and caused
annoyance and anxiety to the gods. Viṣṇu then reincarnated
himself as a dwarf, appeared before Bali, and asked for as
much land as he could cover with three strides. Bali assented
to his request, and Viṣṇu with two strides covered the heavens
and the earth, but, in commiseration for Bali, who then
humbled himself, left him the dominion over the lower

Buddhists it stands for a fully enlightened man who has
achieved perfect knowledge of the truth and thereby is liberated
from all existence and before his own attainment of Nirvāṇa
reveals the method of obtaining it. The principal Buddha of
the present age was born at Kapilavastu in the year 566 B.C.<sup>61</sup>

view rests merely on an analogy which the poet had drawn between his

as a person and consider him to be a mythical personage, or that it
simply meant ‘an arranger’ (Kalyāṇa, Year 41, No. 7, July, 1967, Gita
Press, Gorakhpur, pp. 1036-38). Vyāsa appears as the term for a narrator
of the Epics and the Purāṇas. It came to refer to learned brāhmaṇas who
did this work. It appears that Vyāsa was really a historical person, who
rearranged the Vedas and the Purāṇas. He seems to have started a tradi-
tion or school of learning. After his death his name was associated with
his chair or seat of learning which was maintained by his successors or
disciples. Vyāsa is still the gotra of many families. The literary refe-
rences to Vyāsa are available in the Brāhmaṇas and the Sūtra literature
as well as in the Mahābhārata and the later Sanskrit literature (op. cit.,
Kalyāṇa, pp. 1038-41). Here we do not propose to enter into the compli-
cated question of the date of Vyāsa and connected events and characters.
But, as is well known the Period of the Brāhmaṇas is generally supposed
to extend from 1000 B.C. to 600 B.C., likewise the Sūtra literature is taken
to extend from sixth or seventh century before Christ to about the second
century. The Mahābhārata is generally supposed to have taken its present
form in the long interval from the fifth century B.C. to A.D. 400. But the first
compilation of the kernel of the Mahābhārata story from scattered {%gāthās%}
may be placed much earlier. This receives some support from the tradi-
tion of three stages in the evolution of the Mahābhārata text. If Vyāsa
is accepted as a contemporary of Kṛṣṇa and of the Mahābhārata war we
may place Vyāsa round about 1000 B.C.

She is said to have raised a pillar in the memory of her dead
parents at Rājghāṭ in Vārāṇasī.
<div n="P"/>The first part of the name, Dāman, means a ‘rope’ or
‘girdle’<sup>1</sup> (originally ‘bond’, from {%§dā%} ‘to bind’). But the
Amarakośa gives a better explanation which takes us nearer
to the original meaning. It explains {%‘Dāman’%} as {%‘Sandānam’,%}
i. e., a rope tethered to a cow at the time of milking it.<sup>2</sup> The
second part of the name is {%‘svāminī’%} which means ‘a propri-
etress, mistress’ or owner of (gen., loc. or comp.).<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The parents might have given her this name out of affec-
tion as she was a helping hand in tethering the rope to the
cow while milking it.<sup>4</sup> The name indicates affection by the
parents.

2. {%Devakī%}¦ (No. 13, L. 13):
The reference comes in the passage which describes how
Skandagupta returned victorious to his mother just as Lord
Kṛṣṇa went to Devakī after killing his enemy. <sup>5</sup> Sewell suggests
that the name of Skandagupta's mother was Devakī and he
has been followed by some other scholars. According to D.C.
Sircar the simile may further suggest that some maternal uncle
of Skandagupta actually fought against him in support of his
rival and that his mother, possibly not the chief queen of his
father, had to experience difficulties for sometime. <sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Devakī is a patronymic formed by adding {%‘ī’%} suffix to
Devaka, literally meaning ‘divine, celestial’, who was her
father.<sup>7</sup> She was the wife of Vasudeva and the mother of
Kṛṣṇa.<sup>8</sup>

{%Upāsikā%} (lay-worshipper) Harisvāminī, was the wife of {%Upāsaka%}
Sanasiddha who donated money to the {%Ārya-saṃgha%} (commu-
nity of the faithful) at the great {%vihāra%} (Buddhist convent) of
Kākanādaboṭa (i. e., the great {%stūpa%} at Sāñcī) for feeding
one {%Bhikṣu%} everyday and maintaining lamps in the shrines of
the Buddha.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The first part of the name, Hari, stands alike for Lord
Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu and Śiva. The second part is {%‘Svāminī’%} meaning
mistress. Thus the whole literally means ‘one who has Hari
as her master’.

tions the image of the Jina-vara-pārśvanātha was made.
<div n="P"/>In the inscription we have the un-Pāṇinian use of the locative
‘Padmāvatau’ in place of ‘Padmāvatyām’ but it seems to have
been done to suit the metre.
<div n="P"/>Padmāvatī is a synonym far Lakṣmī. In India it has been a
popular name for women.<sup>10</sup>

of dark complexion’ or it can be a patronymic from Rāma.<sup>12</sup>
Monier Williams mentions the form with short {%‘i’%} suffix (Rāmi)
but it can be with long {%‘ī’%} as well, as we have ‘Devakī’ a
patronymic from Devaka.<sup>13</sup> Chatterji mentions it to be a
feminine form of Rāma and considers it a naming pattern
prevalent among the lower classes<sup>14</sup>

The form of the name should have better been Sabhāṭi. She
was the mother of Dāmasvāminī who raised a pillar in her
memory.
<div n="P"/>The name seems to have some relation with the word
{%Sabhā.%}<sup>15</sup> It can be an adjective from the word {%Sabhā%} combined
with {%§‘aṭ’%} to move. Literally it may mean “one who moves
in assemblies”.

Grahamittrapālita.
<div n="P"/>The first part śāma’ is a contraction of Sanskrit {%‘Śyāma’.%}<sup>16</sup>

dark or swarthy complexion which in Sanskrit poetic tradition
is considered a mark of beauty.<sup>17</sup>

[Page-106+ 31]
<H>CONCLUSION
We may review our discussion before we conclude as follows:
<H>{%Names of the Gupta kings%}
<P>Among the names of the Gupta kings ‘Gupta’ is an example
of an abbreviated name. Chaṭotkaca. Chaṭotkacagupta, Pūru-
gupta and Vainyagupta are the Epic names. Budhagupta is a
{%nakṣatra-nāma%} (name based on constellation). Bhānugupta is a
name based on the Sun god.
<P>Govindagupta, Narasiṃhgupta and Viṣṇugupta are Vaiṣṇa-
vite names. Candragupta (I), Samudragupta, Candragupta (II),
Kumāragupta (I), Skandagupta, Kumāragupta (II) and Kumāra-
gupta (III) are Śaivite names. The names of Skandagupta and
Kumāragupta exhibit the popularity of the war-god Skanda or
Kārttikeya.<sup>18</sup>
<P>The names Candragupta and Kumārgupta were repeated in
the Gupta family which is against the Mahābhāṣya rule<sup>19</sup> that
the first part of the name can be borrowed from one of the
three male ancestors but the second part of the name should
be different. It may be said that the repetition of the second
part could not be avoided due to the tendency of the Guptas
to add to their names the termination ‘Gupta’ which had
almost become their family name.
<H>{%Names of the Gupta queens%}
<P>Among the names of the Gupta Queens Kumāradevī,
Anantadevī, Candradevī, Śrīvatsadevī and Mitradevī were
after gods. In Dattadevī, the name-ending termination ‘datta’
forms the first part of the name. The name Dhruvadevī or
Dhruvasvāminī was based on {%Dhruva%} (polar star). This was
against Smṛti injunctions. Manu says that a brāhmaṇa should
not marry a maiden who bears the name of a constellation,
tree or river, of a low caste, of a mountain, of a bird, snake
[Page-107+ 38]
or slave, or of anything terrifying.<sup>20</sup> The names of women
derived from the names of the {%nakṣatras%} are forbidden by the
Dharmasūtras.<sup>21</sup>
<P>Devī meaning goddess is the common termination in all the
names except Dhruvasvāminī which ends in Svāminī meaning
‘mistress’.
<P>It is interesting to note that Kāmarūpa king Puṣyavarman's
son Samudravarman was named after the Gupta king Samudra-
gupta. Moreover, Samudravarman's queen took the same name
as that of the queen of Samudragupta, i. e. Dattadevī.<sup>22</sup> Barua
considers Samudravarman to be the contemporary of Candra-
gupta II, Vikramāditya and the celebrated poet Kālidāsa.<sup>23</sup>
<P>We also take into account the other feminine names which
are as follows:
<P>(i) Dāmasvāminī
<P>(ii) Devakī
<P>(iii) Harisvāminī
<P>(iv) Padmāvatī
<P>(v) Rāmī
<P>(vi) Sābhāṭi
<P>(vii) Śāmāḍhyā
<P>In feminine names we notice the terminations svāminī and
vatī. We find that the feminine names in our inscriptions
generally end in {%‘ī’.%}
<P>Now we classify the names according to the deities they
represent. Some names were used by more than one person
and somehow seem to have been popular. As they appear in
more than one inscription and for different individuals we have
listed them separately.

based on Śiva but are based on auxiliary deities. Names based
on god Moon are Bhaṭṭisoma, Īśvaracandra, Prabhucandra,
Śaśinandin, Svāmicandra, Somapāla, Candravarmman, Candra-

Though Kṛṣṇa is an incarnation of Viṣṇu<sup>24</sup>, for determining
the currency of names based on Viṣṇu directly, we will not
count names based on Kṛṣṇa.
<P>Lord Rāma is believed to be the seventh incarnation of Viṣṇu.
Rāma occurring in our inscriptions seems to have been Rāma
Rāghava. The names based on Rāma are given below:

<P>The only name based on Goddess Durgā is ‘Durgādatta’.
<P>The two names based on Mātṛ cult (seven Mātṛkas)
follow:
<P>1. Mātṛdāsa
<P>2. Mātṛviṣṇu
<P>There is only one name based on god Varuṇa (Sea-god),
which is Varuṇaviṣṇu.
<P>The names based on Nara form of God are Nārāyaṇadāsa,
Naradeva and Nara-Nandin.
<P>We find that both the Śaivite and Vaiṣṇavite names are
almost equal in number. If we delete the names of allied deities
we get about 51 Śaivite names and 44 Vaiṣṇavite names.
Thus Śaivite names seem to be more popular. An indication of
the leaning of the Gupta kings towards Vaiṣṇavism is clear
from the Garuḍa emblem of the Guptas.<sup>25</sup> The gupta monarchs
also used the title ‘Paramabhāgavata’ i. e.; the devout devotee
of Viṣṇu, in their imperial records. Majority of the names of
Guptas show a preference for Śaivism. We know from the
[Page-113+ 39]
Mathurā Pillar Inscription of the year 61 (No. 41) about the
Lakulīśa sect of the Pāśupatas which was very popular at
Mathurā. Kuśika one of the four main disciples of its founder
Lakulīśa who is regarded as the last incarnation of Śiva finds
mention in this record. Parāśara, Upamita, Kapila and Udita
were the Pāśupata teachers, who flourished in the Gupta
period. We know of the prevalence of the worship of goddess
Durgā and Śiva's two sons, Kārttikeya and Gaṇeśa. There are
two names based on Cupid (god of love) which are Ratibhadra
and Māraviṣa. The popularity of Nāga worship in the Gupta
period known from other sources is confirmed by an analysis
of the names. Other categories of names are Buddhist and Jaina
names which also indicate popularity of Hindu sects to some
extent. They are as follows:
<P>1. Abhayamitra
<P>2. Guhanandin
<P>3. Gośarmman
<P>4. Jitasena
<P>5. Dat(tt)ilācārya
<P>6. Pārśva
<P>7. Buddhamitra
<P>8. Bhaṭṭibhava
<P>9. Bhaṭṭisoma
<P>10. Bhadra
<P>11. Madra
<P>12. Rudrasoma
<P>13. Śaṃkara
<P>14. Śāntideva
<P>15. Sanasiddha
<P>16. Somila
<P>17. Buddha
<P>18. Saṃghiladeva
<P>19. Saṃghila
<P>A large number of names discussed by us reveal an incli-
nation towards Śaivism. Bühler had already proved from the
date of the Sāñcī Stūpa Inscriptions that the worship of Viṣṇu
and Śiva is older than Buddhism and Jainism. It can be gues-
sed that the donors mentioned in the records or their ancestors
adhered to these creeds before their conversion and that they
[Page-114+ 39]
received their names in accordance with the established customs
of their families.<sup>26</sup>
<P>We also find some Epic and Puranic names which show
the popularity of the Epics and the Purāṇas. The names are:
<P>1. Ghaṭotkaca
<P>2. Ghaṭotkacagupta
<P>3. Pūrugupta
<P>4. Vainyagupta
<P>5. Pārtha
<P>6. Pṛthu
<P>7. Vyāsa
<P>8. Yudhiṣṭhira
<P>9. Bhīma
<P>10. Dhanañjaya
<P>11. Sagara
<P>12. Parāśara
<P>Another considerable group of proper names is derived
from the names of Nakṣatras. This shows that the rule in the
Gṛhyasūtras recommending the use of Nakṣatra names, was
obeyed. These names are as follows:
<P>1. Puṣyamitra
<P>2. Dhruvaśarman
<P>3. Dhruvadevī, Dhruvasvāminī (against the rules in case
of women)
<P>4. Budhagupta
<P>Madra and Khāsaka are the two names which may be termed
as tribal names, presumably pointing to the tribes to which
they belonged.
<P>Names based on colour are (1) Kālaka, (2) Kapila, (3)
Piṅgala and (4) Nīlarāja.
<P>The names based on animals are Siṃhaha(da)tta, Siṃha-
nandin, Gaṇḍa, Śarabharāja, Vyāghrarāja, Hastivarmman,
Chagalaga and Śaṇḍaka.
<P>The names based on abstract qualities are: (1) Bhadradeva
Kāmanakuṇḍa, Rūpaśarmman, Suśarmman, Bandhumitra,
Amṛtadeva, Śāmāḍhyā, Ribhupāla, Dhṛtimitra, Matidatta,
Kṣemadatta, Balavarmman, Dhruvabhūti, Matila, and Vīrasena.
We can also classify the names into two categories, Sanskrit
and non-Sanskrit or Prakrit names. A few of the second group
[Page-115+ 39]
may be enumerated here:
<P>1. Piccakuṇḍa
<P>2. Prabhamitra
<P>3. Kaṅkuṭi
<P>4. Bonda
<P>5. Vailinaka
<P>6. Karppaṭika
<P>7. Riśidatta
<P>8. Rāmī
<P>9. Ḍuḍika
<P>10. Līḍhaka
<P>The names of brāhmaṇas occurring in our inscriptions
sometimes end in a non-brāhmaṇic cognomen such as Bhaṭṭa,
Datta and Kuṇḍa, etc., which are available in the inscrip-
tions of Bengal. Surnames like Datta, Dāma, Pālita, Pāla,
Kuṇḍa (Kuṇḍu), Dāsa, Nāga and Nandin are now confined
to Kāyasthas of Bengal but not to brāhmaṇas. Bhandarkar<sup>27</sup>
has pointed out that identical surnames are used by the
Nāgara-brāhmaṇas. It cannot be said definitely whether the
name-endings in dāman occurring in the names of several
Śaka satraps portraying Iranian influence<sup>28</sup> have any relation-
ship with the name-ending {%‘dāman’%} found in our records.
<P>Noticing brāhmaṇic names with a large number of modern
Bengali Kāyastha cognomens in several early epigraphs
discovered in Bengal, some scholars have suggested that there
is a considerable brāhmaṇa element in the present day Kāyastha
community of Bengal. Originally the professions of Kāyastha
(scribe) and Vaidya (physician) were not restricted and could
be followed by people of different {%Varṇas%} including the
brāhmaṇas. So there is every probability that a number of
brāhmaṇa families were mixed up with members of other
Varṇas in forming the present Kāyastha and Vaidya commu-
nities of Bengal. <sup>29</sup>
<P>Kāyasthas frequently figure in our inscriptions usually
as professional writers. The office of Kāyastha (scribe) seems
to have been instituted before the beginning of Gupta period.
It seems likely that they had not developed into a caste during
our period. “This may account for the non-reference to them
as a caste in the contemporary Smṛtis”.<sup>30</sup> Majumdar<sup>31</sup> says
[Page-116+ 42]
that the Gupta emperors were vaiśyas but this is wrong, as we
have shown that they were certainly non-vaiśyas.
<P>Professions were not determined rigidly according to caste.
We find in our records that some brāhmaṇas followed non-
brāhmaṇical professions. Likewise some kṣatriyas followed
non-kṣatriya professions. We find in the Eran Stone Pillar
Inscription of Budhagupta, of the year 165 (No. 18) that
Mātṛviṣṇu, a brāhmaṇa, was a feudatory of the Guptas in
Central India. Indraviṣṇu, and Varuṇaviṣṇu the great grand-
father and grand-father respectively of the donor are described
as pious brāhmaṇas who were engaged in spiritual and religious
pursuits. In the Inscription the heroic and victorious character
of Mātṛviṣṇu is stated. From the Indor Copper Plate Inscrip-
tion of Skandagupta of the year 146 (No. 16), we come to
know that two kṣatriyas Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṃha
were merchants of the town of Indrapura in U.P.

NAMES OF THE TRIBES
[Page-120+ 1]
Blank
[Page-121+ 32]
<H>Prologue
<P>Tribal Names occurring in our records make it clear that
they represented a heterogeneous stock of people in Indian
society and that ethnic or geographical factors predominated.
The locality or country was generally known by the plural of
the tribal name. The original name of the tribe whether
ethnic or territorial may be hypothetical since it is difficult
to determine exactly whether the place gave the name to
the tribe or the tribe to the place. We find many exam-
ples where the tribes gave their names to the places after
they were known by some ethnic or tribal appellations. For
example, we know that Videha obtained its name from the
settlement of the Videgha tribe who were lead by their king
Māthava when they pushed forward to the east from the
Sarasvatī<sup>1</sup> and that Pāñcāla denoted the country or kingdom
which the Kṣatriya tribe Pañcāla occupied.<sup>2</sup> With a definite
territory of their own, they lost their tribal character and
assumed the functions of the ruler. The names of the janapadas
thus given continued even if the tribe migrated somewhere
else; rather it gave the names to the janapadas wherever it
settled. Thus we know the divisions of the Mālavas, Yaudhe-
yas, the Kurus and the Madras.
<P>These tribes went through various vicissitudes due to
the growth of big imperial states viz. of the Mauryas and
the Guptas, and foreigns invasions from the north-west. They
had replaced old Vedic tribes in many places and flourished
during the period from 6th century B.C. to A.D. 4th-5th
century. Though Altekar<sup>3</sup> has pointed out that they flourished
only in north-western and north-eastern zone and conspic-
uously absented themselves in the south, we find the evi-
dence of self-governing people, though scanty, in South
India as well. The Rock Edict XIII refers to some territories
[Page-122+ 39]
in the south which are mentioned as a people and not as
kingdoms.<sup>4</sup> Not only that the Satiyaputras and the Kerala-
putras are also mentioned in the Second Rock Edict of Aśoka.<sup>5</sup>
<P>We find some tribes known probably after proper names
viz., the Yaudheyas and Ārjunāyanas as well as the proper
names used after the tribes.<sup>6</sup> We also know of Madra as a
personal name in our records. K.P. Jayaswal has pointed out
that the śūdra republic is evidently the same whom Alexander
met in lower Sind and whom ‘we have identified with the
brahminical Śaudras or Śaudrāyaṇas of the Gaṇapāṭha’. On
grammar it is based on the proper name (of a man) śūdra,
not the caste-name.<sup>7</sup>
<P>The tribes did not live in isolation and interacted with
society. The bond that held so heterogeneous a society together,
made it a society rather than a set of tribes, was not so much
common ritual and common language but as a whole it was an
aggregate of common needs satisfied by reciprocal exchange.
<P>The indigenous tribes based on caste and family founded
the republican kingdoms. They worked singularly or formed
confederations to save themselves from foreign aggressions.
The republics had emerged from the Vedic tribes and retained
much more tribal tradition than did the monarchies. In the
transition from tribe to republic they lost the essential demo-
cratic pattern of the tribe but retained the idea of government
through an assembly representing the tribe.<sup>8</sup> Tribal organiza-
tion was based on a smaller geographical area and permitted
the functioning of a popular government more effectively.<sup>9</sup>
<P>The words Saṃgha and Gaṇa have been synonymously used
for these republics. Pāṇini makes frequent use of the word
Saṃgha in his Aṣṭādhyāyī. It seems later the word Saṃgha
became representative of the Buddhist order and hence the use
of the term was dropped for a republic and only the word
‘Gaṇa’ was retained for the purpose.<sup>10</sup>
<P>The Āyudhajīvin republics of Pāṇini had become {%Vārtā-%}
{%śāstropajīvins%} by the time of Kauṭilya, probably they had
taken to agriculture and industry side by side with their
common profession of military art. They are enumerated by
Kauṭilya as the Kambojas, the Surāṣṭras, the Kṣatriyas, the
Śreṇis, and ‘others’.<sup>11</sup> The other class of republics bore the
[Page-123+ 39]
title Rājan or king, are as follows: The Licchavikas, the Vṛjikas,
the Mallakas, the Madrakas, the Kukuras, the Kurus, the
Pāñcālas, and ‘others’.<sup>12</sup> Basham opines that the Arthaśāstra
refers ironically to the martial arrogance and practical ineptitude
of the republics when it mentions the members of the seven
named tribes “making a living by the title of {%rājā%}”.<sup>13</sup>
<P>We do not agree with Basham since we know from a
passage in the later Vedic literature that the Uttarakurus and
the Uttaramadras were kingless ({%vairājya%}) states, where
people, the heads of founder families, were consecrated
for the rulership.<sup>14</sup> Kauṭilya has also placed the Madrakas
and the Kurus along with the Licchavis. We can compare them
with the Licchavis whose 7,707 members, probably the
descendants of the founder members of the privileged aristo-
cracy, who were all entitled to the honorific title {%rājā.%}<sup>15</sup> At a
certain time while dealing with the history of republican tribes
in India some extravagant claims were made by some scholars
like K.P. Jayaswal who wrote under nationalistic predilections
to prove that not only a constitutional form of Government,
but the entire parliamentary system, including Address to the
Throne and Voting of grants, was prevalent in India and that
responsible Government, with all that it implies in the West,
existed in ancient India with its full paraphernalia.<sup>16</sup>
<P>It may be mentioned that these republics were not demo-
cracies in the modern sense of the term where franchise is
vested in as large a number of citizens as possible. We find
that some of them had mixed constitutions, while others were
transforming themselves to monarchy. Some of them may even
be termed as oligarchies. We can call them Kṣatriya aristo-
cracies where the power was vested in the hands of consecrated
Kṣatriyas ({%Mūrdhābhiṣikta%}).
<P>Pāṇini<sup>17</sup> distinguishes between the Mālavas or Kṣudrakas
and the Mālavyas and Kṣudrakyas respectively. The former
denoted the Kṣatriya and brāhmaṇa aristocracy while the
latter the common folk. Similarly the Amarakośa distinguishes
between the {%Rājanayaka gaṇa%} and the {%rājaka-gaṇa.%} In the
former the power was vested in the descendants of the original
founder families enjoying the title of the {%rājā;%} whereas in the
case of latter it was vested in all the Kṣatriya families whether
[Page-124+ 30]
descended from the original founders or not.<sup>18</sup>
<P>But the {%Gaṇa%} indicated a certain type of state, sharply
distinguished from monarchy, is proved by a reference from
the Avadānaśataka where it is narrated that when some mer-
chants from Madhyadeśa, travelling in the Deccan, were asked
by a local ruler as to who the kings were in their respective
homelands, they replied, ‘Sir, in the countries of some of us
there are kings but in those of others, there is gaṇa or republican
government’.<sup>19</sup> That gaṇa had a definite constitutional
meaning is also supported by the evidence from the Jain
literature, the coin-legends of the Yaudheyas, Mālavas and
Ārjunāyanas as well as by the writings of the contemporary
Greek writers.<sup>20</sup>
<P>It may be admitted that the ancient Indian republics were
regular states and not mere territories marked for different tribes.
They had crossed the tribal stage and had adopted the monar-
chical system or were transforming themselves to republicanism
or had mixed constitutions. They were small territorial units.
They issued their own coins and the coin-legends in Sanskrit.
It proves beyond doubt that they got Aryanized. They had weak
economy and followed their copper or silver coinage rather
than the gold currency system which had its start with Kaniṣka
in Northern India. In the time of distress or as a friendly
gesture, they worked as auxiliary armies to the kings. Though
at times tributary to the great kingdoms, they exercised
internal autonomy.
<P>Even when they migrated to other lands, it is not necessary
that the whole population migrated, a majority of them might
have succumbed to the onslaughts of the invader or got merged
with the dominant tribe.
[Page-125+ 32]
<H>Tribes
<P>After having said a word about the Gaṇa state which some
of the following tribes represented, we shall now make a
discussion on the names of the tribes occurring in our records:

<L>314<pc>125<k1>आभीर<k2>आभीर
1. {%Ābhīra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
They were one of the tribes subdued by Samudragupta.
Ābhīras lived to the north of the Rajaputana desert. We may
also think of Abiravan between Herat and Kandahar which
may have been the original home of the Ābhīras. In the 3rd
century A.D. there was an Ābhīra kingdom in the north-
western Deccan.<sup>21</sup> D.C. Sircar<sup>22</sup> describes Ābhīra in singular as
a member of the Cowherd Community. The tribe can still be
traced in the present Ahīras,<sup>23</sup> who in tribal groups, abound
largely in the Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and some portions
of Rajasthan. They are a band of simple, sturdy people,
mostly cowherds and agriculturists.<sup>24</sup> This tribe<sup>25</sup> is thought to
have played a big part in the propagation of the worship of
Kṛṣṇa Govinda<sup>26</sup> in his pastoral aspect.
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>27</sup> places the Ābhīras in West Rajasthan
‘where the Sarasvatī disappears’.
<div n="P"/>In the first and second centuries A.D. they are located in
the country between the lower Sindhu valley and Kathiawar,
as is indicated in the ‘Periplus’ and in the Geography of
Ptolemy.<sup>28</sup> The Periplus calls their country Abiria. Ābhīra
generals served in the armies of Śaka Kṣatraps of Western
India in the second century A.D. as is known from their
inscriptions.<sup>29</sup> They are also mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya
of Patañjali<sup>30</sup> in association with the Śūdras, the Sodrai of
Alexander's time, who lived in northern Sind. Throughout
the third century A.D. the Ābhīras exercised ruling power in
northern Konkan and Mahārāshtra.<sup>31</sup> Vātsyāyana<sup>32</sup> refers to
the Harem of the Ābhīra kings. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa<sup>33</sup>
[Page-126+ 39]
and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>34</sup> refer to them as ‘Dakṣiṇāpatha-vāsinaḥ’
or dwelling in the Southern Country. The Bṛhat-saṃhitā<sup>35</sup>
mentions them as being under the jurisdiction of Śani
(Saturn).
<div n="P"/>The Jodhpur Inscription of Saṃvat 918, records that the
Ābhīra people of this area were a terror to their neighbours,
because of their violent demeanour.<sup>36</sup> The Ābhīra robbers are
also mentioned in the Skanda Purāṇa.<sup>37</sup> Epigraphic evidence
indicates the existence of an Ābhīra kingdom in the 14th
Century in Khandesh.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Sāhitya Darpaṇa of Viśvanātha,<sup>39</sup> it is stated that
Ābhīrī is the language of the Ābhīras and Cāṇḍālī of the
Caṇḍālas. Those who do woodwork can speak Ābhīrī or Śābarī,
either of the two. Daṇḍin asserts that the speeches of the
Ābhīras, etc., are termed as Apabhraṃśa in the Kāvya<sup>40</sup> on
the basis of which probably Keith writes: “the Prakrit lyrics
passed into Apabhraṃśa as a result of the activities of the
Ābhīras and the Gurjaras.<sup>41</sup> We know from the Amarakośa<sup>42</sup>
that ‘Ābhīrī’ was used to denote ‘Ābhīra woman or the wife of
a cowherd’.
<div n="P"/>The Amarakośa<sup>43</sup> mentions Gopa, Gopāla, Gosaṃkhya,
Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for Ābhīra and says that
the village or place where Ābhīras lived is named as Ghoṣa or
Ābhīrapallī.<sup>44</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Kashmirian recension of the Mahābhārata we get
the readings ‘Kābhīra’ and ‘Kabhīra’ in place of Ābhīra.<sup>45</sup>
These Kashmirian forms may have resulted from an attempt
to record an initial glottal opening in the language of the
Ābhīras. The Kasmiras probably knew the Ābhīras at an early
date.<sup>46</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattacharya<sup>47</sup> describes the Ābhīrs or Ahīrs as a cowherd
caste exceeding 8,000,000, and found almost everywhere in
India north of the Narmadā. The Ābhīras are mentioned as
foreigners in the Purāṇas.<sup>48</sup> Their kings were regarded as
vrātya and mostly śūdras (black).<sup>49</sup> In the Mahābhārata the
Ābhīras are called Mleccha.<sup>50</sup> According to Manu<sup>51</sup> they were
the sons of a brāhmaṇa man and an ambaṣṭha woman, the
Ambaṣṭhas being of mixed origin and known as the Ānava
kṣatriyas.<sup>52</sup> The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>53</sup> places the Ābhīras in the
[Page-127+ 39]
Southern quarter of India.
<div n="P"/>Shafer<sup>54</sup> considers them to be an admixture possibly of
white Iranian blood with enough Bhil blood to give them a
a very dark colour and concludes that they were western
Ānavas.<sup>55</sup>

2. {%Ārjunāyanas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>The name Ārjuneya is mentioned in the Ṛgveda as the
patronymic of Kautsa.<sup>56</sup> The tribe, associated with the name
of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and the North-West up to
the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.<sup>57</sup> The
word Arjuna in the Vedic literature<sup>58</sup> denotes ‘white’ and
‘white lepresy’ and is also an epithet of Indra. But it does not
denote a tribe or a human hero.
<div n="P"/>The word Arjuna has an unmistakable resemblance with
the Śaka word erzuna, meaning a ‘leader’ or ‘chief’ which is
derived from arzi. Analogous to it are the Śaka words {%aljsā,%}
meaning ‘silvery’ and {%āljsata,%} meaning ‘silver’, that are akin to
the Avestan word {%erezata%} (silver), the Sanskrit word {%rajata%}
(silver) and the Persian word {%arziz%} (tin).<sup>59</sup> All these words have
the original sense of whiteness and brightness, that are also
connoted by the word arjuna in Sanskrit. It is highly significant
that Arjuna, the hero of the Mahābhārata, is said to have borne
this name, because he was ‘white’ and ‘pure’ in action.<sup>60</sup> All
over the Eurasian steppes the nobles were regarded as ‘white’
and the commoners were considered ‘black’. Hence the word
for white colour was employed to denote the idea of leadership.
This is why {%erzuna%} was used in the sense of a ‘leader’ in Śaka
languages.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vedic and Śaka both branched from the same parent Indo-
European language. Hence many words were common to both.
But whereas arjuna in Vedic lost its pristine sense and was
only used as an adjective, signifying ‘whiteness’, in Śaka it
meant a ‘tribe’ and a human hero and later on this sense was
imparted to this word in India as a result of the impact of the
Śakas.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="P"/>The tribe, bearing the name of Arjuna, was also connected
with some people of Chinese Turkestan, whose heroes, and
kings had this designation.<sup>63</sup> In the Uighur redaction of the
[Page-128+ 39]
Hiḍimbāvadha<sup>64</sup> the name of Arjuna occurs in the form of
Arcuni.<sup>65</sup> According to Sylvain Levi, this episode of the Mahā-
bhārata owed the privilege of entering into the Turkish world
to the presence of the name of Arjuna in it, who was regarded
as the eponymous founder of the dynasties of some Central
Asiatic oases-states.<sup>66</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini<sup>67</sup> refers to the worshipper of Arjuna, called Arjunaka,
together with the devotee of Vasudeva, called Vāsudevaka.
This remark implies that Arjuna was treated as a deity at the
time of Pāṇini and his followers occupied a prominent posi-
tion. <sup>68</sup> The Kāśikā replaces Auddālakāyana of Patañjali by
Ārjunāyana,<sup>69</sup> the name of a tribe nearer to its own time in
discussing the meaning of Prācya-bhārata (II. 4. 66).
<div n="P"/>From the accounts relating to the invasion of India by
Alexander we learn that a tribe named {%Agalassoi%} (Arjunāyana)
fought with Alexander.<sup>70</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhat-saṃhitā<sup>71</sup> places the Ārjunāyana in the northern
division of India and describes them as being in the region of
Bṛhaspati.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ptolemy refers to a people in the Punjab whom he calls
{%Pandoouoi%}<sup>73</sup> = Pāṇḍavas with whom the Ārjunāyanas may be
connected.<sup>74</sup> Ārjunāyana coins are found in the Mathurā
region and ‘they may be assigned with probability to the region
lying west of Agra and Mathura, equivalent, roughly speaking,
to the Bharatpur and Alwar States’.<sup>75</sup>

3. {%Āṭavika-rāja%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
It is stated in the inscription that Samudragupta made all the
kings of the forest countries his servants.<sup>76</sup> A mention
of the forest kingdoms has also been made in Khoh Copper
plate inscription of Saṃkshobha Gupta year 209.<sup>77</sup> These
18 forest kingdoms were apparently in Central India
including Ḍāhala or the Jabalpur region. <sup>78</sup> We find a refe-
rence to the same in the Kanas plate of Lokavigraha.<sup>79</sup>
The Vāyu and Matsya Purāṇas (XLV, 126 and CXIII, 48)
read Āṭavyas which is no doubt the correct reading. Āṭavī as
a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Mahābhārata.<sup>80</sup> The
Āṭavyas were certainly the same as the Āṭavikas of the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal
tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.<sup>81</sup> We find
[Page-129+ 39]
a reference to the Āṭavikas or the forest savages in the
Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya and it was an Arthaśāstra practice
to hire the Āṭavikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,<sup>82</sup> which
needs must influence their future advance to civilization.
Āṭavika-rāja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of
forest countries’. We get a reference to Jāṅgalas in the Puranic
List of Peoples.<sup>83</sup> Similar terms {%‘vana-rāṣṭra’%} ‘forest-countries’
and {%vana-rājya%} ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the Bṛhat-
Saṃhitā.<sup>84</sup> But these countries lay in the north-east division
of India, as mapped out by Varāhamihira, and they are, at
any rate, not the countries referred here.<sup>85</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata, in one line of
Sahadeva's {%digvijaya,%} Professor Franklin Edgerton changes
{%Āṭavī%} to {%Antākhi,%} so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome
and the Greeks. Antioch, Rome and Greece were intimately
associated in history and consequently they are still associated
in the minds of Western scholars, and hence {%Antākhi%} made
more sense to Edgerton in connection with Rome and the
Greeks than {%Āṭavī.%} But it only represents his personal opi-
nion.<sup>86</sup>

4. {%Daivaputra%}¦<sup>87</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
Daivaputras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and
Muruṇḍas are mentioned to have paid homage to Samudra-
gupta by rendering to him all kinds of service.
<div n="P"/>The word ‘Daivaputra’ denotes those ‘who belong to
{%devaputra%}’, i. e., Kaniṣka, i. e., the Kuṣāṇa ruler. The title
devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kuṣāṇa
kings.<sup>88</sup>
<div n="P"/>The common belief is that the designation {%devaputra%} ‘god-
son’ was copied by the Kuṣāṇas from the ancient Chinese
imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.<sup>89</sup> Thomas considers
that this title used by the Kuṣāṇas must have been borrowed
from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly
from the Chinese.<sup>90</sup> Narain also believes the title to have been
borrowed by the Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia.<sup>91</sup> The title has
been frequently used by the kings in the Kharoṣṭhī documents
discovered from Chinese Turkestan.<sup>92</sup> As regards the origin of
the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in
many ancient empires.<sup>93</sup> The ancient Indian concept for ‘Deva-
[Page-130+ 39]
putra’<sup>94</sup> meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used
for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished
divinities, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used
for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters,
East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In
the later Kuṣāṇa times, the term seems to have denoted the
sense of Royal insignia.<sup>95</sup> In a Buddhist text of this period the
question is raised ‘why kings are called {%devaputra%}’ and the
answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding
among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods
(each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="P"/>That Daivaputra denotes the Kuṣāṇas is obvious, since, no
other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’.
Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do
not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as
{%deva.%} The Kuṣāṇas did not adopt {%devaputra%} as an official title
in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading
on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which
has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in
consultation with Allan.<sup>97</sup> Kaniṣka has not used the title even
in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved.
It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title
{%‘devaputra’%} is used for the Kuṣāṇa kings.<sup>98</sup> The title is used for
the first time for Kaniṣka (known as Candana Kaniṣka).<sup>99</sup>
{%Mahārāja -rājātirāja devaputra%} Kuṣāṇa of the Taxila Silver
Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kaniṣka.<sup>100</sup>
As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll
inscription is the first known instance of the application to
the Kuṣāṇas of the designation devaputra, which regularly,
though not invariably, recurs with Kaniṣka and his succes-
sors.”<sup>101</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by
the Kuṣāṇa rulers themselves but was applied to them by the
Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kuṣāṇas were
designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas
suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the
Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand
Yakṣa and those of the burly Kusāṇa kings and the superior
title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appel-
[Page-131+ 39]
lation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity
between the Kuṣāṇa kings and Kubera (described in India as
regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra
in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means
god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the
Kuṣāṇas. Aśvaghoṣa refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as
‘guardian of the northern heaven’.<sup>102</sup> It is also likely that
the title devaputra may have been given due to Śiva-maheśvara,
whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole
deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.<sup>103</sup> These facts
need further investigation.
<div n="P"/>Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of
Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity
and not as a title.<sup>104</sup> Aśoka could claim the title only of
{%‘Devānām priya’%}<sup>105</sup> meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus
{%Devaputra%} or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kuṣāṇas
by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet {%Devaputravat%}
has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions<sup>106</sup>

<L>318<pc>131<k1>हूण<k2>हूण
5. {%Hūṇa%}¦ (No. 13, L. 15):
They are mentioned in the Bhītarī Stone Pillar Inscription
of Skandagupta in which Skandagupta (A.D. 455 — 467) is
stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hūṇas: “By
whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when
he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirl-
pool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas...”.<sup>107</sup> The defeat
inflated upon the Hūṇas proved so decisive that for nearly
half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their
depredations.<sup>108</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hūṇas, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a
Central Asian tribe.
<div n="P"/>Uigur<sup>109</sup> transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient
Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xūnu or xunu’,
the other {%‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’.%} The first part ({%xun%} — ) of the last
form is not in doubt and neither is the {%u%} of the last part, the
only question is about the change of the initial {%i%} of ancient
Chinese into {%y%} in Uigur before {%u%} and in Sandhi, and about
the pronunciation of the final consonant.<sup>110</sup>
<div n="P"/>The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close
to the {%Hunu%} as to the Sanskrit {%Hūṇa%} is very similar to the
[Page-132+ 39]
Chinese “transcription” {%Xunu%} or {%Xūnu,%} and Avesta {%Hunu,%}
except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel {%‘u’%}
the stem final — a characteristic of the names of peoples in that
language. “The Purāṇas have a form {%Urṇa%} which together with
Epic Skr. {%Hūṇa%} suggests Indic Hūrṇa Turk, {%Xūrnu%}”.<sup>111</sup>
<div n="P"/>We may note here the Tibetan {%Hor,%} which corresponds
with the first syllable of the reconstructed form {%Hūr-ṇa.%} The
difference of vowels may indicate a back diphthong or back
vowel between {%o%} and {%u,%} as Ptolemy's Xoūnoi suggests, since
the Greeks wrote {%u (y)%} for Indic {%u.%}<sup>112</sup>
<div n="P"/>Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form,
we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were
applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns,
Hūṇas etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have
been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosi-
birians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have
been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that
there must have been several subject people and subject armies
in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and
mutual influence — ethnic, linguistic and cultural.<sup>113</sup> Otto
Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the
basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology,
and archaeology<sup>114</sup> and has pointed out that the greater part
of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol<sup>115</sup> Later
Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the
{%Hsiung%}-nu and {%Huns%} were Turks.<sup>116</sup>
<div n="P"/>Louis Bazin<sup>117</sup> and Von Gabain<sup>118</sup> also reached the conclu-
sion that in language of the {%Hsiung-nu%} there was a high percent-
age of Turkish words.<sup>119</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the second century B.C. the {%Hiung-nu (Huns)%} started a
movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying
the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence
of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central
Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half
of the fourth century A.D., a branch of them, the White Huns,
or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time
when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of
Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had
begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their
[Page-133+ 39]
horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the
Guptas into pieces’.<sup>120</sup>
<div n="P"/>In A.D. 484 the Hūṇas killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia.
Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a
vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.<sup>121</sup> We know
of a {%Hūṇa-deśa%} placed to the South of the Kāma-giri and to
the North of Maru-deśa, i. e., the desert called the land of
heroes. The Harṣacarita places the Hūṇa country in the Punjab
region practically suggesting the same area.<sup>122</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king
of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the
Hūṇas and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their
king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.<sup>123</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know of Toramāṇa from his Eraṇ Boar Inscription<sup>124</sup>
and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.<sup>125</sup> These
two are generally taken to have been Hūṇa chiefs. There is
another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab)
referring to {%Rājādhirāja Mahārāja%} Toramāṇa-Ṣāhi-Jau (bla),
whom some scholars identify with king Toramāṇa mentioned
in the Eraṇ Inscription,<sup>126</sup> but others regard the two as quite
different.<sup>127</sup> Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscrip-
tions describes any of these kings as Hūṇas nor contains any
reference to the Hūṇas.
<div n="P"/>We find an interesting account of Toramāṇa in the Jain
work, Kuvalayamālā, composed to 700 Śaka (A.D. 778).<sup>128</sup> Here
Toramāṇa is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrab-
hāgā (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a
scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.<sup>129</sup>
<div n="P"/>Both Toramāṇa and Mihirakula are referred to in the Rāja-
taraṅgiṇī, but there is no mention of their being the Hūṇas.
<div n="P"/>It is doubtful whether Toramāṇa and Mihirakula were Hūṇas
or Kuṣāṇas. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal<sup>130</sup> and Fleet<sup>131</sup> held that
Toramāṇa was a Kuṣāṇa. But Sten Konow<sup>132</sup> holds that Tora-
māṇa was, in all probability, a Hūṇa, as is generally assumed,
and not a Kuṣāṇa. It is not unlikely that the Hūṇas and the
Kuṣāṇas were ethnically allied and were later merged into a
new nation, which came to be known as Hūṇa in India.<sup>133</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are several stray references to the Hūṇas in Indian
literature. D.C. Sircar<sup>134</sup> opines that the Indian names {%Hūṇa,%}
[Page-134+ 39]
{%Hārahūṇa%} or {%Hārahūra,%} supposed to be associated with the
Chinese name {%Hiung-nu%} and ‘the White Hun’ of the European
writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Mahābhārata
and in the geographical sections of the early Purāṇas, can be
roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A sūtra-vṛtti in the
Candra Vyākaraṇa has the sentence ‘{%ajayad-gupta%} (or Japto or
Jarto) {%Hūṇān%}’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to
express an event which occurred within the life-time of the
author.<sup>135</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman<sup>136</sup> a reference
is made to the chiefs of the Hūṇas, but they are not named.
The inscription simply says that Yaśodharman possessed coun-
tries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hūṇas
could subdue.<sup>137</sup>
<div n="P"/>The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier
bowed only to the god Sthāṇu (Śiva) and whose forehead was
pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm
of Yaśodharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.<sup>138</sup>
<div n="P"/>With the fall of Yaśodharman, which probably took place
not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the
early part of the sixth century A.D. Śākala become his capital.<sup>139</sup>
The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was
probably Narasiṃha-Gupta Bālāditya. He was temporarily over-
whelmed by the victorious raids of Yaśodharman, and Mihirak-
ula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend
his power. Narasiṃhagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was
forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihira-
kula but finally triumphed over his rival.<sup>140</sup>
<div n="P"/>The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed
the political supremacy of the Hūṇas in India who ceased to
be even a disturbing element in Indian History.<sup>141</sup> The Purāṇas
place the Hūṇas in the extreme west, with the Sauvīras,
Saindhavas, Śākalas and Madras.<sup>142</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Raghuvaṃśa, Kālidāsa mentions Raghu defeating
the Hūṇas on the banks of the Vaṅkṣu or the Oxus<sup>143</sup>, the (pale)
faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands
(who died in the battle).<sup>144</sup>
<div n="P"/>Varāhamihira<sup>145</sup> mentions them under the jurisdiction of
Ketu and places them in the North.<sup>146</sup> Dr. Upendra Thakur<sup>147</sup>
[Page-135+ 39]
remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hūṇas almost
lost their original name of {%Hiong-nou%} or {%Huns.%} Later the powerful
Turks give its name to the entire Hūṇa nation by which they
were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards
they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the
powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the {%Hiong-nou%} or
{%Huns%} received different names in different periods beginning
with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In
spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts
of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their
exact origin and ethnic affinities.
<div n="P"/>We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their
merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols
but the Hūṇas find their mention in the Harṣa-Carita of Bāṇa
(a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in
the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-Malwa-
Gujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced
by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and
also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pāla kings
of Bengal<sup>148</sup>

<div n="P"/>D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>154</sup> takes them to be the Kharparas
mentioned in the Batihagadh Inscription<sup>155</sup> of the Damoh
district of M.P. Kharpara<sup>156</sup> means a thief, a rogue or a cheat.
The name Kharaparika does not occur elsewhere in inscrip-
tions or literature. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa<sup>157</sup> mentions
a tribe called Khara-sāgara-rāśīs,<sup>158</sup> along with the Gand-
haras and the Yaudheyas; and the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>159</sup> refers
to a country named Kharapatha, watered by the river Nalinī.
It is difficult to say whether Khara-sāgara-rāśī and Kharapatha
[Page-136+ 39]
had anything to do with the Kharaparikas.<sup>160</sup> K.P. Jayaswal
expresses the probability of the identification of the Kharapa-
rikas with the five Karpaṭas of the Mahābhārata.<sup>161</sup>

<L>321<pc>136<k1>कोतस्<k2>कोतस्
8. {%Kotas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 14):
The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta mentions
Samudragupta's capturing a king born in the family of the
Kotas.<sup>162</sup> Mookerji equates the Kota-kulaja of the inscription
with king Kalyāṇavarman of the play ‘Kaumudī-Mahotsava’.<sup>163</sup>
But it is now generally believed<sup>164</sup> that ‘the episode of the
Kaumudī-Mahotsava has no bearing whatsoever on the early
Gupta History’.
<div n="P"/>The coins of the Kotas bearing their name have been found
in East Punjab, and Delhi, and ‘they probably ruled in the
Upper Gangetic valley’.<sup>165</sup> Scholars differ in their views
about placing the Kotas; some identify it with Kanyakubja
while others with Pāṭaliputra.<sup>166</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is known that Puṣpapura or Kusumapura was the name of
both the Pāṭaliputra and Kānyakubja.<sup>167</sup> It must, however, be
noted that the city of Puṣpa here is connected mainly with
Samudragupta and not with the Kota-kulaja,<sup>168</sup> so the location
of the city of the Kotas is not to be traced in Kusumapura or
Puṣpapura. It is well known that Candragupta I received
Magadha through his Licchavi-alliance and it is possible that
Samudragupta enjoyed his youth playfully at Pāṭaliputra
({%Puṣpa-āhvaye krīḍatā%}). So Goyal's assumption that ‘Hariṣeṇa
has referred to Kānyakubja and not Pāṭaliputra’<sup>169</sup> is incorrect.
It is only later that Kānyakubja gains the honour of being
called Kusumapura when the glory of Pāṭaliputra had started
declining.<sup>170</sup>
<div n="P"/>In view of the context of the victory over Kota-kulaja
along with the Nāga kings Acyuta and Nāgasena and with the
support of numismatic evidence it may be said that the kotas
lived somewhere between East Punjab and Delhi.

9. {%Kurus%}¦ (No. 22, L. 7):
The Kurus were divided into two branches, the Northern and
the Southern.<sup>171</sup> We have here a reference to the Uttarakurus.<sup>172</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kurus were one of the most ancient and prominent of
the Indo-Āryan kṣatriya tribes.<sup>173</sup> In the earliest literature the
Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But
[Page-137+ 39]
mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (Glory of the
Kurus)<sup>174</sup> and of a Pākasthāman Kauravyāyaṇa.<sup>175</sup> The Athar-
vaveda<sup>176</sup> refers to Parīkṣita as a king of the Kurus and his
son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>177</sup>
as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>Oldenberg<sup>178</sup> seems to be right in suggesting that the
Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes
referred to by other names in the Ṛgveda. Kuruśravaṇa,
shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the
Ṛgveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’
who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is
likely that the Tṛtsu-Bharatas, who appear in the Ṛgveda as
enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the
Kuru people.<sup>179</sup> Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas
occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found.
Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Ṛgveda<sup>180</sup> as
having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the
Sarasvatī — that is to say, in the sacred places of the later
Kurukshetra.<sup>181</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇa literature, the Kurus are often con-
nected with Pāñcālas.<sup>182</sup>
<div n="P"/>The territory of the Kuru-Pāñcālas is declared in the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).<sup>183</sup>
A group of the Kuru people still remained further north — the
Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.<sup>184</sup> It appears from a
passage of the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the
Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the
Kuru — Pāñcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>185</sup>
There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was
developed in the country of the Kuru-Pāñcālas, and that it
spread thence east, south and west. <sup>186</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic
and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>187</sup> where they are located beyond the Himalayas
(pareṇa Himavantam). In another passage,<sup>188</sup> however, the
country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasiṣṭha Sāthavya
to be a land of the gods ({%deva-kṣetra%}), but Jānṃtapi
Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly
mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the
[Page-138+ 39]
northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kuruk-
shetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir
might naturally be found.<sup>189</sup> In Buddhist literature, Uttara-
Kuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are
some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory
of a country that once had a historical existence.<sup>190</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical
constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are
told by Kauṭilya<sup>191</sup> that the Kurus were {%‘rāja-śabdopajīvinaḥ’,%}
or ‘enjoying the status of rājan’ — i. e. all citizens had equal rank
and rights.<sup>192</sup>
<div n="P"/>Shafer<sup>193</sup> shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas
were Āryan, the bulk of the population were probably non-
Āryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas
rallied the support mostly of the non-Āryans, the Pāṇḍavas
had the support of Āryans and concludes that the Northern
Kurus were Muṇḍic.<sup>194</sup>

L. 18; No. 13, L. 3: No. 21, L. 5; No. 40, L. 4; No. 47,

The epithet ‘Licchavi-dauhitra’ (daughter's son of the Licchavi)
for Samudragupta occurs in all these Gupta records It
suggests the importance of Candragupta I's marriage with the
Licchavi princess Kumāradevī. The alliance had no social
importance but it was important for political gain by virtue
of which Candragupta I (Samudragupta's father) gained power-
ful position in Magadha and the neighbouring countries. In
the Candragupta-Kumāradevī-coins, we have no mention of
the Guptas but only of the Licchavis in plural {%‘Licchavayaḥ’%}
(the Licchavis). This supports the amalgamation of the
Guptas with the Licchavis and we may agree with Majumdar
that ‘the epithet {%Licchavi dauhitra%} was deliberately given to
Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession to the dual
monarchy’.<sup>195</sup>
<div n="P"/>We also know of a house of the Licchavis at Nepal<sup>196</sup> but
the separate reference to Nepal as a tributary province in the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta<sup>197</sup> proves that it
was different from the Licchavi kingdom which Samudragupta
had inherited from his mother. The Licchavi kingdom of
[Page-139+ 39]
Kumāradevī may be located in North Bihar with Vaiśālī
(modern Basarh in Muzaffarpur district) as its centre.<sup>198</sup> It was
a credit for the astute diplomacy of Candragupta to marry the
Licchavi princess as we know, in ancient times, the Licchavis of
Vaiśālī had been the rivals of the kings of Pāṭaliputra<sup>199</sup> and
that they did not marry outside their area.<sup>200</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of this powerful people has come to us in many
different readings:
<div n="P"/>Licchavi, Lecchavi, Lecchai, Lecchaki, Licchvi, Nicchivi,
<div n="P"/>Lichikki and Lichavi.
<div n="P"/>Of these the Licchavi has been most commonly used in
literature.<sup>201</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of this people is in Kauṭilya's Artha-
śāstra,<sup>202</sup> where they are called Licchavis. Here we read that
the corporations of Licchivi, Vṛji, Malla, Madra, Kakura,
Kuru, Pañcāla and others were {%‘rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ’.%} It is note-
worthy that Kauṭilya distinguishes the Licchavis from the Vṛjis
though some scholars consider them to be one.<sup>203</sup> H. Pandey<sup>204</sup>
says that it appears from the Pali suttas that the names Vajji
and Licchavi are interchangeable to some extent. But the
accounts of Chinese pilgrims point to a different conclusion.
Fa-Hien describes the kingdom of Vaiśālī where ‘Licchavis’
were the people of the country. He does not mention Vṛji or
Vajji. Hiuen Tsang describes Vaiśālī and Vṛji as two distinct
countries, and Watters is inclined to doubt the accuracy of his
description of the Vṛji country.<sup>205</sup> But we know that Vajji was
a powerful confederacy of which the Videhas along with the
Licchavis, Jñātrikas, Ugras, Bhojas and others were the cons-
tituent confederate clans (aṭṭhakula). Of these the Licchavis and
the Videhas were the most important, and the Licchavi Capital
Vaiśālī was the head-quarter of the confederacy.<sup>206</sup> But Ray
Chaudhuri observes: “Vajji was not only the name of the
confederacy but also of one of the constituent clans. But the
Vajjis like the Licchavis are sometimes associated with the
city of Vaiśālī which was not only the capital of the Licchavi
clan, but also the metropolis of the entire confederacy”.<sup>207</sup> The
Licchavi republic was generally called the saṃgha or gaṇa of
the Vajjis. The Licchavis would not possibly have allowed this
name, had they not themselves been Vajjians. In one passage,
[Page-140+ 39]
the Licchavi Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis
who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is
represented as saying, “They (i. e. the Licchavis) will become
Vajjians, they will become Vajjians ({%bhavissanti Vajji bhavis-%}
{%santi Vajji)%}”! This possibly only means that there was great
hope of these Licchavi young men becoming true Vajjians,
practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the
Buddha, conditions which endured their prosperity, and lead-
ing a more cultured life. Thus the Vajji appears to be a more
dignified term. It might have originally been given to the tribe
which inhabited what is known as {%Vajjiraṭṭha (Vṛji-rāṣṭra),%} i. e.,
the Vajjian country, in Buddhist literature. Later a separation
seems to have taken place among the Vajjis and Licchavis,
because the Arthaśāstra (XI. I) mentions the Licchavika and
the Vṛjika as two distinct republics.<sup>208</sup>
<div n="P"/>The clan of the Licchavis figures very prominently in the
annals of early Buddhism. Buddhaghoṣa, the celebrated Pali
commentator has the following story<sup>209</sup>: The chief queen of
the king of Benaras, at the time of her child-birth delivered
lump of flesh, ‘of the colour of lac and of bandhu and Jīvaka
flowers’. Fearing the displeasure of the king if he should hear
of this, the other queens put the lump of flesh into a casket
marked with royal seal and placed it on the flowing waters of
the Ganges. The casket was discovered by an ascetic, and
taken by him to his hermitage, where he cared for the lump of
flesh. After the lapse of some time, tha lump broke up into
two pieces of flesh, which gradually assumed shape, till finally
one of them became a boy resplendent like gold, and the other a
girl. Whatever entered the stomach of these two infants looked
as if put into a vessel of precious transparent stone {%(maṇi)%}
so that they seemed to have no skin {%(Nicchavi).%} Others said: ‘the
two were attached to each other by their skin {%(līna-chavi)%} as if
they had been sewn together’; so that these infants came to be
designated ‘Licchavis’. We are further told that on coming of
age the boy and the girl were married to each other and from
this brother and sister union sprang the race of the Licchavis<sup>210</sup>
<div n="P"/>The origin of the Licchavis has been a matter of great
controversy. They have been represented as Scythians, Kolari-
ans, Tibetans and Persians by different authorities.<sup>211</sup>
[Page-141+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Samuel Beal<sup>212</sup> takes the Licchavis or Vajjis to be a
branch of the ‘Yue-Chi’ forgetting that the latter came to India
in the first century B.C. while the Licchavis were a highly
civilized and prosperous people in the sixth century B.C.
<div n="P"/>In the opinion of J.P. Hewitt, there are “very strong
indications that the Vajjians, who were certainly the earliest
settlers in the country, were of Kolarian race who had lived
there long before the arrival of the Dravidians and Āryans”.
The learned writer ignores the existence of the pre-Vajjian
Āryan dynasty of rulers at Vaiśālī.<sup>213</sup>
<div n="P"/>V.A. Smith<sup>214</sup> found similarities between the customs of
the Tibetans and those of the Licchavis in the practice of the
exposure of the dead and also in judicial procedure. And
hence he came to the conclusion that the Licchavis, the
ruling tribe or clan in Vṛji country of which Vaiśālī was the
capital, was really a Tibetan (or Mongolian) tribe which settled
in the plains during the prehistoric times. The view has been
criticised by B.C. Law, K.P. Jayaswal, H.C. Raychaudhuri
and others on the following grounds<sup>215</sup>:
<div n="HI"/>(1) The custom of the disposal of the dead was prevalent
among the Vedic Āryans from whom the Licchavis
were descended;
<div n="HI"/>(2) In the case of Tibet we have only three courts as
against the seven tribunals of the Licchavis; further
we know very little about the relative antiquity of the
Tibetan procedure which might very well have been
suggested by the system expounded in the Aṭṭhakathā.
<div n="P"/>S.C. Vidyābhūṣaṇa<sup>216</sup> suggests a Persian origin for the
Licchavis holding that the name Licchavi ({%Nicchavi%} of Manu,
X. 22) was derived from the Persian city of {%Nisibis.%} There
is very little in Vidyābhūṣaṇa's surmise except a fancied
resemblance between the names Nicchivi and Nisibis. Inscrip-
tions of the Achaemenids are silent about any Persian settle-
ment in the Eastern India in the sixth or fifth century B.C. The
Licchavi people were more interested in {%Yakṣa caityas%} and the
teaching of Mahāvīra and the Buddha than in the deities and
Prophets of Iran.<sup>217</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Licchavis have been invariably represented as kṣatriyas
in ancient Indian literature. As the Mahāparinibbāṇa-Sutta
[Page-142+ 39]
informs us, they claimed a share of the remnants of the
Buddha's body on the ground that they were kṣatriyas like the
Buddha himself: “The Exalted one was a kṣatriya and so are
we. We are worthy to receive a portion of relies of the Exalted
one”. We get many other similar instances.<sup>218</sup> We find that
both the Śākyas (to whose race the Buddha belonged) and the
Licchavis are described as progenies of brother and sister
unions. Like the Śākyas, the Licchavis are also described as
kṣatriyas.<sup>219</sup> Manu speaks of the Licchavis as kṣatriyas, though
of the Vrātya variety.<sup>220</sup> Regarding the Vrātyas, Manu says:
‘Those (sons) whom the twice-born have by the wives of equal
caste, but who, not fulfilling their scared duties, are excluded
from the initiation to {%Sāvitrī,%} one must designate by the appel-
lation vrātyas’.<sup>221</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, was the
very kin of the Licchavis and that he had many followers
among the residents of Vaiśālī, even among the highest officers.
Then again, between the sixth century B.C. and 200 B.C., the
earliest estimated date of the Manusmṛti,<sup>222</sup> the Licchavis had
won the good graces of the Buddha as well as of the followers
of the religion he preached. During this long interval, when the
two great ‘heretic’ faiths flourished in their country, the
Licchavis might not have been particular to the ceremonies and
practices that the regulations of the orthodox brāhmaṇas
required. ‘Hence we can understand how Manu, the great
brāhmaṇa law-giver came to refer to the Licchavis as
Vrātyas’.<sup>223</sup> But Gokhale<sup>224</sup> takes the term kṣatriya in this
context to mean representative of political power rather than
a specific caste in the brahminical hierarchy and from the word
{%Vrātya%} infers that they were outside the pale of the brahminical
civilization.
<div n="P"/>Scholars have divergent views about the connotation of the
word ‘Vrātya’.<sup>225</sup> Charpentier described the Vrātyas, as a band
of people not governed by the rules of caste, probably repre-
senting the worst elements of Indian society, — the thief, the
robber, the drunken one, etc. But Keith rejected this view by
pointing out that Manu's reference to the {%Rājanya Vrātyas,%}
e. g. Licchavis and Mallas (X. 22) has no value for Vedic
times.<sup>226</sup> Haver in his article ‘Der Vrātya’ derives ‘Vrātya’
[Page-143+ 39]
from {%‘vrata’.%} Thus the oldest meaning of ‘Vrāta’ is a group of
people bound by holy ceremonies, bound by a vow to cult-
actions being derived from {%‘vrata’%} which is a vow taken in the
service of a god. The {%Vrātīnas,%} on the other hand, ‘were
Aryans of a more primitive culture and religion, than the
orthodox brāhmaṇas, and were organised in cult-unions and
both {%‘vrātya’%} and {%‘vrātīna’%} being derived from {%‘vrata’%} are
‘members of the same holy union’. The only difference between
them apparently was that the Vrātīna went to the brāhmaṇa
countries to perform the Vrātya-work and were paid for it,
while the Vrātyas acted in their own homeland.<sup>227</sup>
<div n="P"/>From all these considerations, we can see that the views of
Manu and the suggestion of B.C. Law are more tenable. In
the Nepāla Vaṃśāvalī, the Licchavis are allotted to the Sūrya-
vaṃśa or solar race of the kṣatriyas.<sup>228</sup> This is quite in agree-
ment with the fact elicited from the Buddhist records that they
were Vāsiṣṭhas by {%Gotra,%} for we know from the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>229</sup> that the {%gotra%} or {%pravara%} (family) of a kṣatriya is
the same as that of his {%purohita%} or family-priest. The Vasiṣṭha
{%gotra%} was, therefore, the {%gotra%} of their family priest, and we
know that the Vasiṣṭhas were the family priests of the kings of
the solar race, especially of the Ikṣvākus.<sup>230</sup>

11. {%Madrakas%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. We also know
of Madra as a personal name in No. 15, L. 8.
<div n="P"/>Madras claimed descent from an eponymous king Madraka,
son of Śibi Auśīnara, and were septs of the family of Śivi
like the Kaikeyas.<sup>231</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Dr. Buddha Prakash ‘Bhadra’ was another
Variant of Madra.<sup>232</sup> But this view is not acceptable to us.
The Mahābhārata<sup>233</sup> mentions the Bhadras, but only in the
Bombay recension; the Calcutta recension has Madra.<sup>234</sup> We
know that Bhadra and Madra had independent existence, as
found in the legend of Bhadrā Kākṣīvatī, bride of Vyuṣi-
tāśva.<sup>235</sup> The queen had seven children, three Śālvas and
four Madras. <sup>236</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Candravṛtti on Candra<sup>237</sup> informs us that Udumbara,
Tilakhala, Madrakāra, Yugandhara, Bhuliṅga and Śaradaṇḍa,
are the divisions of Sālva (or Śālva). The word Śālva literally
[Page-144+ 39]
means an animal like stag or gazelle which bespeaks of
Scythian origin.<sup>238</sup> Buddha Prakash connects it with the
modern sub-caste Saluja (Skt. Sālvaja). Anyhow, we know that
Madras were a branch of Śālvas who were sons of Bhadra.
J. Przyluski<sup>239</sup> considers the Madras to have been a section of
the Bhadras on the ground that the former had among their
ancestress a queen named Bhadrā. Both the Bhadras and the
Madrakas are mentioned separately in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,<sup>240</sup> the
Bhadras with the Śālvas in the Madhyadeśa (Middle land)
and the Madrakas with the Mālavas in the northern quarter.
<div n="P"/>Nakula and Sahadeva were the sons of Pāṇḍu by his
wife Mādrī. The name of their mother Mādrī suggests their
connection with the clan of the Madras.<sup>241</sup> Since Bālhiki
(Bāhlika stands for the Bactrians) was the title of Mādrī,
Madras were of Irano-Bactrian origin; the Madras may rep-
resent the Iranian tribe, Māda or Mede.<sup>242</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Madras were an ancient kṣatriya tribe.<sup>243</sup> We do not
find their mention in the early Vedic Saṃhitās but the Vaṃśa
Brāhmaṇa (of the Sāmaveda) tells us of a Vedic teacher named
Madra-gāra Śauṅgāyani (‘descendant of Śuṅga’) whose pupil
was Kāmboja Aupamanyava.<sup>244</sup> Zimmer<sup>245</sup> concludes, with pro-
bability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas
and the Madras. We know from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>246</sup>
that the Madra country was the chief centre of Vedic learning.
We know of a Kāpya Patañcala amongst the Madras who
was a famous teacher of Vedic lore.<sup>247</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras’ are referred
to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>248</sup> as living beyond the Himalaya
({%pareṇa himavantam%}) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara
Kurus, probably, as Zimmer<sup>249</sup> conjectures, in the land of
Kashmira. The Madras mentioned in the Upaniṣads were, like
the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kurukshetra in the
Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Land’.<sup>250</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini<sup>251</sup> mentions two divisions of the Madras, Pūrva
(eastern) and Apara (Western). In the Bṛhatsaṃhitā they are
mentioned twice; firstly as Madra situated in West in Vāyavya
Koṇa,<sup>252</sup> and secondly as Madraka with Mālava in the
North.<sup>253</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Rāmāyaṇa, we read that Sugrīva sent monkeys to
[Page-145+ 39]
the Madrakas and other tribes in quest of Sītā.<sup>254</sup> The Madra
tribe or kingdom<sup>255</sup> is mentioned in the Bhīṣmaparvan of the
Mahābhārata (chap. IX) and in Pāṇini's grammar (II, 3, 73;
IV, 4, 67). The Madras held the Central portions of the
Punjab;<sup>256</sup> they appear in the Epic period to have occupied
the district of Sialkot, between the rivers Chenab and Ravi,<sup>257</sup>
or according to some between the Jhelum and the Ravi.<sup>258</sup>
S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>259</sup> says that the Madras held the portion in
the Doab between the Chenab and the Ravi, possibly com-
prising even a portion of the country between the Jhelum and
the Chenab, and thus abutted on Kaikeya on the West.
We get a clue to the inhabitance of the Madras from a verse
in the Karṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata<sup>260</sup> which refers to a
Madra, who had come to live among the Kurus, as yearning
for his return to his native place beyond the Śatadru and the
Irāvatī to enjoy the company of charming women.
<div n="P"/>Śākala (Pali-Sagala, modern Sialkot) was the capital of the
{%Madras%} identified<sup>261</sup> with Sanglawala-Tiba, to the West of the
Ravi. From the Milinda-pañho, we learn that king Milinda
(Menander) a Graeco-Bactrian king, who became a convert to
Buddhism, was ruling over the Madda country with Sagala as
his capital which according to a Buddhist lexicon, was one of
the twenty ancient cities.<sup>262</sup> The brahminical name<sup>263</sup> of the
Madra Capital was Śākala mentioned by Pāṇini<sup>264</sup> as Sānkala.
In the Mahābhārata<sup>265</sup> and the Jātakas<sup>266</sup> Śākala is described
as standing on the bank of the Āpagā in a tongue of land
between two rivers, called the Śākaladvīpa, which corresponds
to the Rechna Doab.
<div n="P"/>We know from the Mahābhārata about Śalya, king of the
Madras (Madrarāja). <sup>267</sup> After severe fighting, and many
vicissitudes, the Madra soldiers were killed by Arjuna.<sup>268</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Madras are mentioned in the Purāṇas as well.<sup>269</sup> The
Viṣṇu Purāṇa<sup>270</sup> refers to the Madras along with the Ārāmas,
Pārasīkas, and others and in the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>271</sup> with
Gāndhāra, Yavana and others. The latter<sup>272</sup> mentions king
Aśvapati of Śākala in the kingdom of the {%Madras.%}
<div n="P"/>The {%Madras,%} according to the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya<sup>273</sup>
were a corporation of warriors and people enjoyed the title of
{%rājan (rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ).%}<sup>274</sup>
[Page-146+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Madra women were noted for their beauty. <sup>275</sup> The Jātakas
bear ample testimony to the fact that the Madra princesses
were sought in marriage by the great kṣatriya house of North
India.<sup>276</sup> The Mahābhārata tells us that it was a family custom
of the {%Madras%} to receive a fee from the bridegroom when they
gave their daughters in marriage.<sup>277</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some scholars identify the {%Madras%} with Vāhlika (or
Vāhīka).<sup>278</sup> Śākala as a Vāhīkagrāma is also mentioned by
Patañjali.<sup>279</sup> From the references in the Mahābhārata, Vāhīka
would appear to have stood for the whole of Punjab.<sup>280</sup> The
Vāhīka-grāmas of Śākala and Pātanaprastha, as referred to
in the grammatical works,<sup>281</sup> imply the inclusion of {%Madra-%}
{%janapada%} in the Vāhīka country.
<div n="P"/>The {%Madras%} are known as low, barbarous<sup>282</sup> and sinful
people.<sup>283</sup> They are mentioned as base, impure and contemp-
tible.<sup>284</sup> “Amongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are
lost”<sup>285</sup> and so it is said: “Neither one should create enmity, nor
friendship with a Madraka”.<sup>286</sup> The Rājataraṅgiṇī also records
similar views.<sup>287</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the advent of the {%Jarttikas%} or {%Jartas%} (modern Jāṭs) who
spread over the whole of Punjab was responsible for the degene-
ration of the Madras.<sup>288</sup> The legend of Sāvitrī and Satyavan
is connected with the Madra country, for Sāvitrī was the
daughter of Aśvapati, king of Madra.<sup>289</sup> In the Udyogaparvan
the camp of Śalya is described as full of warriors, whose strange
armours, bows and banners, unfamiliar trappings, vehicles and
equipment and local costumes, ornaments and deportment
presented a unique spectacle in the country of the Kurus. <sup>290</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the early part of the sixth century A.D. the Madra
country passed under the rule of the Hūṇa conqueror Mihira-
kula (A.D. 515-535) who ruled from Sialkot. The Madras
continued to flourish even up to the time of the Pāla king
Dharmapāla in the 9th century A.D.<sup>291</sup>

12. {%Mālava%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22; No. 17, L. 19; No. 32, L. 11):
We know Mālava as a tribe which was subjugated along with
some other tribes by Samudragupta (No. 1). No. 17 refers to the
Mālava-gaṇa<sup>292</sup> which has been translated by Fleet as ‘the tribal
constitution of the Mālavas’ in the sense of the event of some
formal establishment of the Mālavas’ as a tribe.<sup>293</sup> Fleet fixes
[Page-147+ 39]
it up as 57-56 B.C.<sup>294</sup> Thomas<sup>295</sup> translates the expression as
“the continuance (sthiti) of the tribal constitution (gaṇa) of
the Mālavas” and adds “It was to {%gaṇa-sthiti,%} not to {%gaṇa,%} that
I gave the meaning of ‘tribal constitution’; and I did not intro-
duce the idea of ‘Continuance’.” My amended translation is
“the usage of the Mālava tribe.”<sup>296</sup> Thus the expression {%‘Māla-%}
{%vānām gaṇa’%} refers to the Mālavas as a tribe. No. 32 speaks of
the Mālava-vaṃśa which has been translated as ‘the race of
the Mālavas,<sup>297</sup> but it would be better to translate it as “the
dynasty of the Mālavas”.<sup>298</sup> It seems that this tribe had esta-
blished independent rulership and so we find the word {%‘vaṃśa’%}
used where the word {%‘gaṇa’%} could also be used<sup>299</sup>
<div n="P"/>Dr. Buddha Prakash holds that Madras and Mālavas were
the same, in Prakrit Madra becomes Malla, as {%‘dra’%} is changed
into {%‘ll’.%} He identifies {%Malla%} with the Malloi of the Greeks
and Mālava of the Epic. He points out that the sons of Aśva-
pati, king of the Madras, were called Mālavas after their
mother, according to decree of Yama which shows that Madra
and Mālava were identical.<sup>300</sup>
<div n="P"/>But we venture to disagree with the learned scholar. The
Bṛhatsaṃhitā mentions Madraka and Mālava separately but
side by side as people of the North.<sup>301</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the time of Samudragupta, the Mālavas possibly lived in
Rajasthan and West Malwa<sup>302</sup> consisting of Mewar, Tonk and
adjoining regions of south-east Rajasthan.<sup>303</sup> They settled in
various localities in Western India after having migrated from
the Punjab where they had fought with Alexander on the lower
banks of Ravi.<sup>304</sup> Their original home was in Jhang District,
Punjab. <sup>305</sup> Subsequently they became the inhabitants of Malwa
and the Vikrama era derived its original appellation from
them.<sup>306</sup> That the Mālavas had migrated to the Jaipur region
(Rajasthan) from the Punjab is supported by the fact that the
legend on some Mālava coins found in Rajasthan reads from
right to left as in Kharoṣṭhī, which was prevalent in the
Punjab and the north-west from very early times.<sup>307</sup> The Sikhs
of Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Jind and Malerkotala are
still known as Mālava Sikhs, probably, because these regions
were populated by the Mālavas in ancient times.<sup>308</sup> Mālava
and Mālavaka are also to be differentiated, the former is
[Page-148+ 39]
Mālava proper while the latter is lesser Mālava with the diminu-
tive suffix {%‘ka’.%}<sup>309</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mālava is the same as {%Malloi%} of the Greeks.<sup>310</sup> Pāṇini does
not mention them by name, but his sūtra, V. 3. 117 speaks of
{%‘āyudhajīvī saṃghas’,%} or tribes living by the profession of arms,
and the Kāśikā says that amongst these saṃghas were the
Mālavas and Kṣudrakas.<sup>311</sup> The Mālava tribe is actually men-
tioned in the Mahābhaṣya of Patañjali.<sup>312</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata couples the Mālavas with the Tri-
garttas,<sup>313</sup> as well as with the Śivis and Ambaṣṭhas.<sup>314</sup> But
soon they migrated southwards and settled somewhere in Rajas-
than where we find them at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>315</sup>
Many coins found at Nagar, 45 miles north of Kota, have the
legend. {%“Mālavānām jayaḥ”%} (victory of the Mālavas) in letters
belonging to the period from 250 B.C. to A.D. 250. According
to Cunningham these coins show that the existence of the
Mālavas as a recognised and important clan, long before their
tribal constitution led to the establishment of their era.<sup>316</sup> The
Mālavas came into conflict with Nahapāna's son-in-law Uṣava-
dāta who subdued them.<sup>317</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Purāṇas<sup>318</sup> the Mālavas are associated with
the Saurāṣṭras, Avantis, Ābhīras, Śūras, and Arbudas, dwell
along the Pariyātra mountains. Thus they seem to have occupi-
ed other territories besides the Punjab or Rajasthan. Pargiter
points out that even according to the Purāṇas the Mālavas
lived in a ‘mountanious’ country, and were nowhere near pre-
sent Malwa. Mālava king were taken as vrātya and mostly
śūdra in the Purāṇas.<sup>319</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bhīṣmaparvan of the Mahābhārata mentions the western
(pratīcya) and northern ({%udīcya%}) sections of the Mālavas.<sup>320</sup>
But the Rāmāyaṇa locates the Mālavas in the east. <sup>321</sup> Kāma-
sūtra's commentator Jayamaṅgala, who flourished later than
the fourteenth century, says that Āvantika, which is identical
with Ujjayinī-deśa, is {%apara-Mālava.%}<sup>322</sup> This has led some
writers to suggest that Mālava proper is Daśārṇa. But Jaya-
maṅgala's geographical knowledge was not perfect.<sup>323</sup> His
remark on Mālava is to be rejected as it runs counter to earlier
authorities. Rājaśekhara mentions Mālava, Avanti and Vidiśā
and the Mañjūśrī mentions Mālava, Vidiśā and Daśārṇa side
[Page-149+ 39]
by side<sup>324</sup> Modern Malwa is the region around Ujjayinī and
Bhilsa. The influence of the Mālavas in the Mandasor region is
proved by the fact that they could impose their tribal era upon
the Mandasor princes.<sup>325</sup> An inscription describes the subjuga-
tion of Sapta-Mālava by Daṇḍanāyaka Anantapāla, a feudatory
of Vikramāditya VI.<sup>326</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Harṣacarita of Bāṇa refers to the ‘wicked Mālava king’
generally identified with Devagupta, who killed Grahavarman
Maukhari, but was himself defeated by Rājyavardhana.
B.C. Law places the kingdom of Devagupta between Prayāga
and Bhilsa which is identical with Pūrva-Mālava.<sup>327</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus the Mālavas originally belonged to Jhang District
in Punjab (now in Pakistan), from where they spread all
over Punjab and by the time of Samudragupta had migrated
to Rajasthan. The Mālavas had emerged in 250 B.C. as an
independent tribal state. But they came under the subservience
of the Śakas in the Ist century B.C., to the western kṣatraps
from the 2nd to the 4th centuries A.D. and to Samudragupta
in the 4th century A.D., but this typical native state exerted
itself again.<sup>328</sup> In the period after about A.D. 550 they seem to
have migrated further to the east and covered the region from
Bhilsa (Eastern Malwa) to Prayāga.<sup>329</sup> During the rule of the
Pālas of Bengal they seem to have migrated still further east;
for the copper plates of the Pāla kings (excepting Dharmapāla),
refer to the Mālavas as mercenary troops in their army.<sup>330</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of the tribe survives in the modern province of
Malwa (a transformation of the word Mālava), and in the brāh-
maṇa castes called ‘Mālavīs’ or ‘Mālavikas’. They are the brāh-
maṇas of Mālava proper and the adjoining country, but are found
also in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.<sup>331</sup>

13. {%Mleccha%}¦ (No. 14, L. 4):
According to Sircar<sup>332</sup> Fleet conjectures the reading to be
Mleccha. The last few letters in line 4 after {%‘ni’%} are not legible.
So how Fleet could take this reading without putting any
doubt is really surprising. Mlecchas were amongst the enemies
defeated by Skandagupta in this inscription (No. 14). The war
with the Mlecchas probably refers to his fight with the Hūṇas
which is specifically referred to in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription.
Whether the Mlecchas are the same as Hūṇas or were a
[Page-150+ 39]
different tribe, both the records (No. 13, No. 14) claim that
Skandagupta completely defeated these enemies.<sup>333</sup> The fact
that in both the inscriptions, the reference to the fight with the
Hūṇas and Mlecchas is preceded by a reference to the falling
fortunes of the family supports the identification.
<div n="P"/>We also find a reference to the oppression of the earth by
the Mlecchas in the epilogue of the play {%Mudrā-Rākṣasa%} written
by Viṣākhadatta where it is prayed that ‘The earth may now be
protected by “His Highness” along with relatives and retinue
by king Candragupta’. It is probable that the play was written
after the Rāmagupta episode and probably the word Mleccha
in this context alludes to the Śakas who were suppressed by
Candragupta II in the guise of the Gupta queen Dhruvasvāminī.
<div n="P"/>D.C. Sircar<sup>334</sup> is of the view that Mleccha is the name
applied to the Muhammadans and other foreigners. In the
Sanskrit language originally there does not appear to have
been any general term for a foreigner. But as the {%Dāsa, Dasyu,%}
{%Barbara,%} and {%Mleccha%} became more or less absorbed in Āryan
civilization and the original specific meaning of these terms
was no longer remembered, these words came to be used for
any foreigner.<sup>335</sup>
<div n="P"/>The word Mleccha was used to refer to both the eastern and
western Ānavas. In course of time it came to be used for almost
any non-Āryan and even for Āryans of impure speech. Subse-
quently the term meant something like “foreigner”, but that was
after most of the Ānavas had become assimilated.<sup>336</sup> When not
used in association with the foreigners the word Mleccha is
used for one who is impure, dirty or uncultured. It is derived
from the root {%§mlich~mlech,%}<sup>337</sup> meaning to speak indistinctly
(like a foreigner or barbarian who does not speak Sanskrit).
We find the use of root in Mahābhāṣya.<sup>338</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sanskrit term Mleccha, referring to the indistinct
speech of some non-Āryans, is taken from proto-Bodish (proto-
Tibetan) {%mltśe%} “tongue”, Old Bodish {%ltśe,%} Kukish generally
{%mlei,%} the combination of initial consonants ({%mltś%} — ) being
simplified in various ways in different Tibeto-Burmic languages.
Aspiration cannot occur after {%I%} in old Bodish; and the proto-
Bodish form may have been {%mltse%} for all we know, so the {%‘cch’%}
of Sanskrit “Mleccha may come nearer the primitive affricate
[Page-151+ 39]
than anything preserved in the Tibeto-Burmic languages.
Since {%‘mleche’%} would be an impossible combination in Sanskrit,
{%mleccha%} would be as close as a Sanskrit speaker could come to
it”.<sup>339</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mleccha<sup>340</sup> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>341</sup> in the
sense of a barbarian in speech. Here the brāhmaṇas are for-
bidden to use barbarian speech. The example<sup>342</sup> given of such
speech is {%“he' layo”,%} explained by Sāyaṇa as {%“he' rayaḥ”,%} “ho,
foes”. The barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though
not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prakrit form of speech.<sup>343</sup>
<div n="P"/>An ancient tradition regards the Andhras, Pulindas and
Śabaras as dog-eaters or Mlecchas.<sup>344</sup> The Jain Prajñāpanā
records two divisions of the people of India — {%Milikkha%} and
Ārya, and enumerates 53 people in the former group, some of
which are the Saga, Javana, Sabara, Vavvara, Hoṇa, Romaya,
Pārasa and Khasa.<sup>345</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>346</sup> states that the Mlecchas dwelt in the
Yavana, Cīna and Kamboja countries. In a dual between
Karṇa and Śalya, Karṇa highly condemns the people of the
Vāhīka and especially of the Madra Country and describes
them as the Mleccha, the dirt among the human beings.<sup>347</sup>
They belong to unpious countries and are totally ignorant
about the Dharma (righteous conduct).<sup>348</sup> At another place,
it is stated that the Yavanas are the Mlecchas, though they
follow their own ways (i. e. not following the Vedic Orthodoxy)
yet they are full of knowledge and brave but the Vāhīkas and
the Madras are condemned as utterly foolish.<sup>349</sup> This makes it
clear that the people not following the righteous conduct
according to the Āryan beliefs, whether indigenous or foreign,
were labelled as the Mlecchas. The Mahābhārata<sup>350</sup> shows that
the coastal regions were the favourite resort of the Mlecchas
and that they were dreadful. The Epic describes the Mlecchas
as being impure because they were of bovine extraction and
describes them as fierce and cruel.<sup>351</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the {%Manu-Smṛti%}<sup>352</sup> the king is advised to exclude at
deliberation time, the foolish, dumb, blind, and deaf, birds,
the aged, women; the Mlecchas (the impure), diseased and
deformed. At another place in the {%Manu-Smṛti%} where the girls
bearing the names after a star, a tree, (or) a river, one called
[Page-152+ 39]
after the {%Antyas%} or a mountain, one called after a bird, snake,
or slave or with a terrifying name are forbidden for marriage,
Kullūka, the commentator on Manu explains the word {%Antya%} as
representing the Mlecchas.<sup>353</sup> From the Manu<sup>354</sup> it is clear
that the Mlecchas spoke a different language than the Āryans.
<div n="P"/>The {%Vāyu, Matsya%} and {%Brahmāṇḍa%} Purāṇas state that the
seven Himalayan rivers pass through the Mleccha countries.<sup>355</sup>
In the {%Varāha Purāṇa,%} a place named Lohārgala is stated to be
ruled over by the Mleccha kings.<sup>356</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Amara-kośa<sup>357</sup> describes the Kirātas, Śabaras and
Pulindas as the {%Mlecchajātis.%} The Bṛhat-Saṃhitā<sup>358</sup> places
them in the West and describes them as unrighteous. It places
them under the jurisdiction of {%Maṅgala graha%}<sup>359</sup> and assigns
them the region of {%Rāhu graha,%} inhabiting the mountain-tops,
low-regions or the caves.<sup>360</sup> In the ‘life’ of Hiuen Tsang, all
places to the north of Lamgham district have been described as
{%Mi-li-ku,%} i. e. frontier or Mleccha lands.<sup>361</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Ārya-mañjūśrī-Mūla-kalpa, the Mlecchas frequently
appear as the companions of robbers.<sup>362</sup> In the Kathāsarit-
Sāgara,<sup>363</sup> the Mlecchas are connected with Sindh. They are
stated to have killed brāhmaṇas, interfered with sacrifices, and
carried off the daughters of hermits.<sup>364</sup> The Rājataraṅgiṇī<sup>365</sup>
mentions the Mlecchas as issuing forth from the valleys adjoin-
ing the Himalayas.
<div n="P"/>In medieval inscriptions, the name Mleccha has been applied
indiscriminately to all foreigners.<sup>366</sup> The Mleccha army of the
Gwalior Praśasti of Bhoja consisted of the Arabs.<sup>367</sup> The
Mlecchas of the inscriptions of the medieval period refer to
Muhammadans and the people of Baluchistan.<sup>368</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Siddhānta-Kaumudī<sup>369</sup> describes the {%Kṣudhunas%} as the
Mlecchas. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra (a work of the 17th
century), we get reference to the Mleccha (verse 24), Mahām-
leccha (verses 28, 30) and {%Mleccha-mārga%} (verse 31) where they
are mentioned along with Pāñcāla, Kāmboja and Bāhlīka and
the Khurāśan country is described as the {%Mleccha-mārga.%}<sup>370</sup>

14. {%Muruṇḍas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
Muruṇḍa is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of
Samudragupta along with the terms Daivaputra, Ṣāhi Ṣāhān-
uṣāhi and Śaka as one compound expression.<sup>371</sup> Fleet takes
[Page-153+ 39]
Śakas and Muruṇḍas as two separate tribes. They were one of
the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer
allegiance to Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>According to Sten Konow {%‘muruṇḍa’%} is the later form of
a Śaka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘Śaka-
Muruṇḍa’ therefore possibly stands for those Śaka lords or
chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Surāṣṭra and
Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>372</sup>
<div n="P"/>But we find in the Khoh plates of Mahārāja Sarvanātha
the names ‘Muruṇḍadevī’<sup>373</sup> and Muruṇḍasvāminī<sup>374</sup> which
shows that {%Muruṇḍa%} was the name of a tribe and not a title.
<div n="P"/>On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith<sup>375</sup> suggested that “the
Muruṇḍas may possibly have been settled in the hill country of
Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south
in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhota-
nagpur”.
<div n="P"/>According to R.K. Mookerji,<sup>376</sup> the people called here as
the Muruṇḍas are to be distinguished from the Śakas and may
be identified with the Kuṣāṇas, as earlier suggested by Sten
Konow.<sup>377</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that the term {%Daivaputra%} in the inscription has
been used to refer to the Kuṣāṇa kings, and Śakas are men-
tioned separately. So we cannot equate Muruṇḍas with the
Kuṣāṇas as suggested by R.K. Mookerji.
<div n="P"/>Some scholars regard Muruṇḍa as the name of a powerful
foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.<sup>378</sup> According
to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word
equated with Muruṇḍa) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the
Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is,
therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description
of the capital refers to Pāṭaliputra.<sup>379</sup> Jayaswal took Śaka-
Muruṇḍa to denote the smaller Śaka rulers like the ‘Shalada,
Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western
Satraps’.<sup>380</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Abhidhāna-Cintāmaṇi<sup>381</sup> and the Vaijayantī<sup>382</sup> the
{%Lampākas%} are identified with Muruṇḍas. The {%Lampākas%} are
the same as the {%Lambatai%} of Ptolemy.<sup>383</sup> The Purāṇas,<sup>384</sup>
mention {%Lampākas,%} the people who were residing in {%Lampāka,%}
the modern {%Laghman%} in Afghanistan. Rājaśekhara seems to be
[Page-154+ 39]
referring to Lampāka as Limpaka.<sup>385</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Muruṇḍas seem to be a foreign tribe. Muruṇḍa is
clearly a non-Āryan word and can have no Āryan derivation.<sup>386</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Muruṇḍas for the
first time under the name {%Moroundai%} and places them on the
western border of the {%‘Gangaridai’.%} They seem to have occu-
pied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar
on the east of the Gaṅgā, as far as the head of the delta. They
had six important cities, all to the east of the Gaṅgā: Boraita,
Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These
places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna
appeared to have some relation with Kālinadī or Kālindī river,
and {%Aganagora%} with {%Aghadip (Agradvīpa)%} on the eastern bank
of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.<sup>387</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Cunningham, the name of the {%Marundai%} is
still preserved in the country of the Muṇḍas, a hill tribe
scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.<sup>388</sup> But M.S.
Pandey<sup>389</sup> opposes the view on the ground that the Muruṇḍas
dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence
is strong enough to show that the Muruṇḍas had not spread so
far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. How-
ever, barbarous and pastoral the Muruṇḍas might have been
before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre
in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality
and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized.
Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as
that of the Muṇḍas of the modern times. Moreover, the
Muṇḍas are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the
Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the
Muruṇḍas, we should have found them in other parts of
Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far
from their place of origin.<sup>390</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.S. Pandey<sup>391</sup> disagrees with the Puranic account on the
basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mis-
takes of the copyists.

16. {%Puṣyamitras%}¦ (No. 13, L. 11):
The Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription<sup>397</sup> records Skandagupta's
victory over a powerful enemy called the Puṣyamitras, who
possessed a strong army and a rich treasury: he (Skandagupta)
placed (his) left foot on a foot-stool which was the king (of
that tribe himself).<sup>398</sup> H.R. Divekar suggested the reading
{%Yudhy-amitrān%} in place of {%Puṣyamitrān.%} But, as pointed out by
R.D. Banerji,<sup>399</sup> the proposed reading is impossible.
<div n="P"/>There are several views about the identification of the
Puṣyamitras.
<div n="HI"/>(i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the
Purāṇas as {%Paṭumitras%} and located them on the
Narmadā.<sup>400</sup>
<div n="HI"/>(ii) V.A. Smith<sup>401</sup> regarded them as a people of the North.
<div n="HI"/>(iii) Hoernle believed that they were the same as the
{%Maitrakas.%}<sup>402</sup>
<div n="HI"/>(iv) R.D. Banerji<sup>403</sup> regarded them as the first wave of the
Hūṇas.
<div n="HI"/>(v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Puṣyamitras
were the descendants of king Puṣyavarmā of Assam.<sup>404</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattasali says that a pun (śleṣa) has been used for “the
descendants of Puṣyavarman of Assam who had so long been
{%mitras%} or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by
their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from
the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar,
“there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support,
for this interpretation of the name Puṣyamitra”.<sup>405</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns
to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacri-
fices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on
the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta.
[Page-156+ 39]
<div n="P"/>We know that the definite limits of Skandagupta's reign
are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of
Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because
we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter
of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be
settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough
calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans
of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.<sup>406</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Puṣyamitras cannot be a branch of the Hūṇas as held by
R.D. Banerji. The Hūṇas have been mentioned separately in
the Bhitari Inscription.<sup>407</sup> “By whose (Skandagupta's) two
arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a distur-
bance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict
with the Hūṇas”. Hoernle's view that “the Puṣyamitras were the
same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership
of Bhaṭārka established themselves in Valabhī probably with
the help of the Hūṇa ruler Toramāṇa”;<sup>408</sup> is also not accept-
able as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial
Guptas from the time of Bhaṭārka to that of Droṇasiṃha.<sup>409</sup>
Therefore, they cannot be the same as Puṣyamitras who rebelled
against Skandagupta.
<div n="P"/>The Purāṇas mention a people called Puṣyamitras, whose
rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the {%Vindhyakas.%}
In the Viṣṇupurāṇa MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have
the following statement: “and Puṣpamitras, and Paṭumitras
and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekalā”.<sup>410</sup>
Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most
correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya
princes from these Bāhlikas and then from the Puṣyamitras and
Paṭumitras who governed Mekalā, a country on the Nar-
madā”.<sup>411</sup>
<div n="P"/>A similar statement is to be found in the Vāyupurāṇa,
according to which ‘the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras are
grouped with the rulers of Mekalā, whose seven kings have not
been named.<sup>412</sup>
<div n="P"/>The mention of {%Vindhyakas,%} evidently a people of the
Vindhya region, and of Mekalā, points to the south rather than
to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Puṣyamitras were
a people of the North is not acceptable.
[Page-157+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Thus the view of Fleet that the Puṣyamitras are to be placed
in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of
the Narmadā, seems to be most reasonable.<sup>413</sup> This is supported
by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by
D.B. Diskalkar,<sup>414</sup> from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to
the south of the Narmadā, indicates that there was a serious
disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekalā, in the middle
of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising
of the Puṣyamitras in that region.<sup>415</sup>

17. {%Sāhānuṣāhi%}¦<sup>416</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
Ṣāhānuṣāhis are also mentioned to have paid homage to
Samudragupta along with other tribes. The Ṣāhānuṣāhis are
to be identified with the Sassanids or the Sassanian kings. The
title {%‘Sāhānuṣāhi (śahān-śāh)%} has frequently been used by the
Sassanian kings.<sup>417</sup> The contemporary Sassanian emperor was
Shahpur II (A.D. 309-379).<sup>418</sup> The Sassanians are known to
have been the rulers of Persia from A.D. 211 to 651.<sup>419</sup> Accord-
ing to tradition the dynasty is named after its founder Sassan.
His son and successor Papaka, seized power by a coup d'etat
against his suzerain, the Parthian king and his accession was
the starting point for a new era (A.D. 208).<sup>420</sup>
<div n="P"/>Goyal<sup>421</sup> confuses the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
Kālidāsa. But they were different from the Pārasīkas. The
Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they
had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.<sup>422</sup> The Pārasīkas
of Kālidāsa were the Ṣāhis.<sup>423</sup> Though the possibility of a
Kuṣāṇa-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that
at the time of Samudragupta,<sup>424</sup> three kings the Daivaputra (the
Kuṣāṇas), the Ṣāhi (the Persians or the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa),
and the Ṣāhānuṣāhi (the Sassanians) were ruling indepen-
dently.<sup>425</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>426</sup> traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and
Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘Ṣāhānuṣāhi’. But this is
far-fetched. So far as Sahni is concerned it is to be connected
with Sādhanika the name of an officer in the administration of
the early medieval period.<sup>427</sup>
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the Sassanian title Śahan-Śāh was
used for the Great Emperor in Mughal period, which usage
continues. In popular parlance the term is used for calling or

receiving some person respectively.

The Ṣāhis are said to have paid homage to Samudragupta.
From the appendix it is clear that Daivaputra is not an adjec-
tive of Ṣāhi as Goyal<sup>429</sup> has surmised and has identified it
with Kidāra Kuṣāṇa of the Great Kuṣāṇa family.
<div n="P"/>Daivaputras have been interpreted to denote the Kuṣāṇas;
so Ṣāhis cannot be identified with the Kuṣāṇas. They must
have been an independent and separate tribe, and may be
identified with the Persians mentioned in the Raghuvaṃśa in
connexion with the North-Westren conquests of Raghu.<sup>430</sup>
<div n="P"/>Goyal<sup>431</sup> identifies the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
Kālidāsa. But Pārasīkas can never be identified with Sassanians.
The word ‘Pārasīkas’ itself clearly be speaks of the Persians and
is identical with the modern Parasis. Moreover, Ṣāhānuṣāhis
are to be identified with the Sassanians whereas Ṣāhis refer to
the Persians. Even now the king of Persia (Iran) is known as
‘Shāh of Iran’.
<div n="P"/>Ṣāhi is an Iranian or Persian word and seems to have some
relation with Sanskrit root {%§śās%} to rule, which when formed a
noun means ‘a ruler’. <sup>432</sup> The Śāhi dynasty of Kabul was ousted
by the brāhmaṇa minister of the last king. The new dynasty was
also known as the Śāhis and has been mentioned by Al-Beruni
and Kalhaṇa.
<div n="P"/>The word {%Śāha%} or {%Sāhu,%} often used for banias in villages,
is not connected with Ṣāhi or Śāhi but is to be derived from
Sanskrit {%‘sādhu’.%}<sup>433</sup>

(Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great
doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justi-
fied in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense
without corroborative evidence.<sup>436</sup> But the question arises that
was the conquest of Tāmraparṇī (Siṃhala) by Aśoka in his
Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?<sup>437</sup>
<div n="P"/>So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an
independent evidence of its political relation with Samuda-
gupta.
<div n="P"/>We know that after the death of king Mahāsena (A.D. 334 — 62)
of the Lambakarṇa clan his son Sumeghavarṇa ({%chi-mi-kia-%}
{%po-mo%} = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a
contemporary of Samudragupta ({%San-meou-to-lo-kin-to%}).<sup>438</sup> He,
according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gayā to
visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience
for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty
for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarṇa decided to
found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to
Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission,
and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north
of the Bodhi tree.<sup>439</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magni-
ficant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the
pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grand-
eur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its
foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in
tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It
is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich
presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's
prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application
for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’,
one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into
which Siṃhala is included”.<sup>440</sup>
<div n="P"/>Siṃhala is generally identified with Laṅkā. But Varāhami-
hira<sup>441</sup> mentions both of them separately as situated in the
South.
<div n="P"/>Laṅkā has been identified differently by various scholars
with Laṅkā of Madhyadeśa,<sup>442</sup> with Maldives,<sup>443</sup> with the
[Page-160+ 39]
northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay
of Bengal,<sup>444</sup> and with an island off the south-east Coast of Cey-
lon.<sup>445</sup> All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>446</sup> who
remarks that the assumption that Laṅkā is not Ceylon is gra-
tuitous.<sup>447</sup> He points out that in the Rāmāyaṇa Rāvaṇa while
entreating Sītā to be his wife says: {%“Laṅkānāma samudrasya%}
{%madhye mama mahāpurī sāgareṇa parikṣiptā niviṣṭā... ”%}<sup>448</sup>
Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategi-
cal position of Laṅkā: {%Sthitā pāre samudrasya dūrapārasya.%}<sup>449</sup>
Kālidāsa in his Raghuvaṃśa in connexion with {%‘Purīm Laṅkām’%}
writes: {%“Mahārṇava parikṣepam lankāyāḥ parikhālaghum”.%}<sup>450</sup>
With regard to the bridge built by Rāma Kālidāsa notes: {%sa%}
{%setuṃ bandhayāmāsa plavaṅgairlavaṇāmbhasi.%}<sup>451</sup> In the Skanda
Purāṇa<sup>452</sup> and in the Kathāsaritsāgara, we have similar references
to Laṇkā.<sup>453</sup> All these passages point distinctly to the great sea
on the other side of which was situated the great city of Laṅkā.
<div n="P"/>The separate mention of Siṃhala and Laṅkā in many
Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Laṅkā was distinct from
Ceylon.<sup>454</sup> This is hardly convincing for the separate mention
of Mathurā and Śūrasena, Sāketa and Kosala, Gāndhāra
and Takṣaśilā, Avanti and Ujjainī, did not imply any material
geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible
terms in geographical texts of the Purāṇas. In the Puranic
lists, Laṇkā is a territorial name and Siṃhala is an ethnic name.
As the name of a city in the island of Siṃhala, Laṅkā passed
off as a {%dvīpa,%} and the two names were used in the same
geographical sense. A passage in the Rāmāyaṅa runs thus:
{%“Siṃhalān barbarān mlecchān ye ca laṅkānivāsinaḥ”.%}<sup>455</sup> Hiuen
Tsang also mentions {%Seng-ka-lo%} (Ceylon) which included {%Leug-%}
{%ka%} (Laṅkā).<sup>456</sup> As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Mahāvaṃśa
and its commentary show that Laṅkādvīpa (the lower portion)
was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.<sup>457</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name
Laṅkā referred to Ceylon.<sup>458</sup> We may assume further, as seems
very likely, that Laṅkā was the early name of Ceylon and its
literary name as well. Mention is made of {%Laṅkādvīpa%} even in
medieval inscriptions.<sup>459</sup> The Madras museum plates of Jaṭila-
varman refer to the beautiful island of Laṅkā as {%Ilangai.%}<sup>460</sup> Epi-
graphic evidence, however, shows that Siṃhala, another name
[Page-161+ 39]
of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad
plate of Kṛṣṇa III refers to the island of Siṃhala.<sup>461</sup> In another
inscription the king of Siṃhala is described as waiting on the
shore.<sup>462</sup> In other inscriptions Siṃhala is variously designated
as Siṅgala-deśam,<sup>463</sup> Sīlam<sup>464</sup> and Sihala.<sup>465</sup> All this evidence
favours the suggestion that as territorial names Siṃhala and
Laṅkā were convertible terms, although the latter is also
used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably,
correctly, that Laṅkā was the old mythological name for
Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Tāmraparṇī,
and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by {%Palaesi-%}
{%mundus%} or {%Palaesimoundon%} which itself was transformed into
{%Salike, Sereṇdiva%} derived from Pali {%Sihala%} or {%Sihala dīpa.%}<sup>466</sup>
The name {%Palaesimoundon%} is very plausibly based on {%“pāre%}
{%samudrasya”,%}<sup>467</sup> in the description given of Laṅkā as noted
above. Ptolemy's Simoundon<sup>468</sup> also refers to that name. But
in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called {%Salike%} which
responds to {%Siele diba%} of {%Kosmas Indicopleustes%}<sup>469</sup> both of
which have their sources in {%Sihalam%} “the Pāli form of Sanskrit
Siṃhala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other
names such as {%Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,%}<sup>470</sup> the last one yielding
to Ceylon. Marco Polo's {%Seilan%}<sup>471</sup> is a nearer approach to the
modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have
been derived from {%Sela%} or ‘precious stone’, hence the island
was anciently called {%Ratnadvīpa.%}<sup>472</sup> An Arab historian called
it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island
also implies reference to gems. The name {%Sailān%} also occurs in
the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.<sup>473</sup> Al-Beruni
called it {%Singaldīb.%}<sup>474</sup> Siṃhala is perhaps so called as once
abounding in lions.<sup>475</sup>
<div n="P"/>We may note here that there are references to another
Siṃhala quite different from Ceylon.<sup>476</sup> It was placed to the
east of Marudeśa and to the south of the Kāmādri. It is evi-
dently in the Punjab-Rajasthan region and reminds us of the
kingdom of {%Siṃhapura%} mentioned by Hiuen Tsang.

20. {%Śaka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
One of the tribes which is said to have paid homage to
Samudragupta. As we have already discussed in connexion
with the Muruṇḍas, the expression, ‘Śaka-Muruṇḍa’ should
[Page-162+ 39]
not be translated to mean Śaka-lords. Following Fleet<sup>477</sup>
we may better split the expression into two distinct names,
the Śakas and Muruṇḍas.
<div n="P"/>The Śakas in the time of Samudragupta (4th century A.D.)
must be the Śakas of Western India belonging to the {%Satrapal%}
family of Caṣṭana and Rudradāman. In this period the Śaka
ruler was Rudrasiṃha II and his successor Rudrasiṃha III,
whose coins come up to A.D. 390, was killed by Candragupta
II.<sup>478</sup> Other persons of that nationality were ruling in and
about Sāñcī.<sup>479</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Scyths, whom Indians named as Śakas, were originally
living on the borders of Bactria. A nomadic people called
Yueh-Chih by the Chinese forced them to move from that
place. Eventually in the beginning of the first century B.C., the
Śakas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthians of
Iran, and then the Greeks in India.<sup>480</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the middle of the Ist Century B.C. there remained only
a few petty Greek chiefs in India, and the power of the Śakas
reached Mathurā. The Śakas continued the earlier practice
of issuing coins with bilingual legends in Greek and Prakrit.
The earliest Śaka king in India was Maues (about C. 80
B.C.)<sup>481</sup>
<div n="P"/>Towards the close of the first Century A.D., the Sātavāhanas
were pushed out from the North-West Deccan by the invad-
ing Śakas of the Kṣaharāta clan; but the Śatavāhanas under
the greatest of their rulers, Gautamīputra Śātakarṇin recover-
ed their lands about A.D. 130. After this event nothing more
is heard of the Kṣaharātas.<sup>482</sup>
<div n="P"/>Another Śaka dynasty, called the Kārddamaka family but
generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gained control of
Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled
roughly upto A.D. 400, and at the height of their power govern-
ing much of Rajasthan and Sind also. The greatest ruler of
this dynasty was Rudradāman, who has left the earliest impor-
tant inscription in correct Sanskrit,<sup>483</sup> a long panegyric which
records his martial exploits, and his reconstruction of a great
artificial lake at Girnar in Kathiawar, which had been excava-
ted under Candragupta and improved in the time of Aśoka.
This inscription is among the earliest certainly dated records
[Page-163+ 39]
of ancient India, and proves that Rudradāman was reigning in
A.D. 150.<sup>484</sup>
<div n="P"/>Samudragupta's main effort was in the direction of the
West, where the Śakas had ruled for over 200 years and which
was enriched by the lucrative western trade. The Śakas at
that time controlled Malwa and Kathiawar and were a power
to be reckoned with. ‘Though the Allahabad Pillar Inscription
claims that Samudragupta received homage from “the Śaka
lords”, it is probable that he did not measure swords with
them’.<sup>485</sup> It is clear that the Śaka homage to Samudragupta
was not at all sincere and reliable since it was not tendered
to his successor,<sup>486</sup> and Candragupta II had to conquer the
Śakas once again.
<div n="P"/>There is indeed a tradition that on the death of Samudra-
gupta the Śakas succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and
forced the weak king, Rāmagupta, to conclude a dishonour-
able peace.<sup>487</sup> Most authorities reject the story, and deny the
historicity of Rāmagupta, but the recent discovery of copper
coins bearing his name<sup>488</sup> strengthens the suggestion that
the tradition has a basis of fact.<sup>489</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was Candragupta II (C. 376-415), the son of Samudra-
gupta and younger brother of the shadowy Rāmagupta, who
finally defeated the Śakas, soon after A.D. 388<sup>490</sup> So he is
rightly remembered as {%‘Śakāri’%} ‘the enemy of the Śakas’.<sup>491</sup>
<div n="P"/>The trousers were introduced into India by the Śakas and
seem to have been in vogue among the ruling classes during
the Gupta times, for Gupta kings often appear on their coins
as wearing trousers.<sup>492</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas were notorious drinkers. It is said that Cyrus
defeated the Śakas, when they were maddened by wine.<sup>493</sup>
It has been suggested by Buddha Prakash that as a result of
the influence of the Śakas, the vogue for excessive drinking
spread. Strabo<sup>494</sup> speaks of a Bacchanalian festival of the
Persian, in which men and women, dressed in Scythian style
passed day and night in drinking and wanton play.<sup>495</sup> We
know of similar drinking bouts in the Mahābhārata.<sup>496</sup> Prob-
ably the Scythians and the Iranians popularised drinking in
the Punjab. The people of the Gangetic country, sticking to
pristine ideals of moderation did not relish the exotic drink-
[Page-164+ 39]
ing bouts popularised in the Punjab, under Śaka and Persian
influence. Baudhāyana in his Dharmasūtra, Karṇa in the
Mahābhārata, and the Buddha in his discourses denounced
drinking and laid down a prohibition against it.<sup>497</sup> But all
this is not agreeable since Buddha and Baudhāyana belong to a
period before the coming of the Śakas. Āryans have been
great lovers of drinking. We can find sufficient evidence for
the drinking before Śakas.
<div n="P"/>We may here refer to the Śaka Era (A.D. 78), which is
very popular in India even to-day. Traditionally this era is
known to have been founded by a Śaka king who occupied
Ujjayinī 137 years after Vikramāditya. The era may in fact
have been founded by Kaniṣka. It was certainly used early in
the 2nd Centuary A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled
Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence, the use of the era
spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East
Asia.<sup>498</sup> Because of its long association with the Śaka Satraps
the era may have earned its present name.
<div n="P"/>The Śakas came to be included in the category of the mart-
ial classes of ancient India. Manu<sup>499</sup> refers to the warlike
people on the fringes of Āryan civilization, including the
Greeks (Yavana), the Scyths (Śaka), and the Parthians (Pah-
lava), as kṣatriyas who had fallen from grace through their
neglect of the sacred law, but who could be received once more
into Āryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and
performing appropriate penitential sacrifices.<sup>500</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas were a white-skinned tribe or race of people; in
the legends which relate the contests between Vasiṣṭha and
Viśvāmitra, the Śakas are fabled to have been produced by
the cow of Vasiṣṭha, from her sweat, for the destruction of
Viśvāmitra's army.<sup>501</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>502</sup> traces the Śaka invasion on the basis
of literary and linguistic considerations.
<div n="P"/>The name of the capital of the {%Madras,%} Śākala, and that of
the region between the Ravi and the Chenab, Śākaladvīpa, are
based on the word Śaka and are indicative of a Śaka invasion.
Likewise, the name of the clan Śākya, to which Buddha
belonged, enshrines a reminiscence of the word Śaka.
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the place-names ending in {%kanthā%} existing in the
[Page-165+ 39]
whole of the Punjab from the Bannu valley to the Kankhala
region and even beyond suggest an intrusion of the Śakas long
before the time of Pāṇini,<sup>503</sup> who is known to have flourished
one century before the invasion of Alexander, the Great.
{%Kanthā%} is a Śaka word for city<sup>504</sup> and is akin to kadhāvara or
kanthāvara of Kharoṣṭhī inscriptions, {%Kand%} of Persian, {%Kanthā%}
of Khotanese, {%Kandh%} of Sogdian, {%Kandai%} of Pushto, {%Kanda%}
or {%Koent%} of the dialect of the Ṛṣikas. It is significant
that the land beyond the Oxus, the {%Urheimat%} of the Śakas,
abounds in {%Kanthā%}-ending place names, such as Samarkand,
Khokand, Chimkand, Tashkand, Panjkand, and Yarkand.
<div n="P"/>The reference to the stepped-well, called {%Śakandhu%} after
the Śakas, together with that worked by Persian Wheel, known
as {%Karkandhu%} after the Karkians, in a vārttika of Katyāyana<sup>505</sup>
also leads to the same conclusion.
<div n="P"/>At the time of Alexander's invasion the Śakas lived at the
north-western borders of India. That this tide of Śaka inva-
sion, descending from the north-west, touched the eastern
extremity of India, is manifest from the traditions of the
Purāṇas that the Śakas advanced to Ayodhyā during the reign
of King Bāhu and that his son Sagara checked and repelled
them.<sup>506</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mahābhārata the Śakas are stated to have constitut-
ed along with Cūlikas, Tuṣāras and Yavanas, the right wing
of the Krauñcavyūha formed by Bhīṣma on the sixth day of
the battle. <sup>507</sup> Caraka in his medical treatise<sup>508</sup> refers to them
in the context of Central Asiatic tribes, viz. Bāhlika, Pahlava,
Cīna, Yavana and Śaka.<sup>509</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash also tries to trace the remnants of the
Śakas in modern times.<sup>510</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas came into Punjab after the Yavanas or the
Greeks. During their long rule they contributed a great deal
to Indian culture and ultimately became one with the Indian
people.<sup>511</sup> The depth of their influence on Indian society is
manifest from the word {%thakura,%} which implies the ideas of
nobility and divinity and stands for the Rajputs in the Punjab
and is derived from the word {%thagora, taugara%} or {%tukhara.%}<sup>512</sup>
The name {%Tukhāra%} itself survives in the name of the {%Tokhi%}
caste found in the North-West.<sup>513</sup> Another caste called Khosla
[Page-166+ 39]
is a survival of Kusulaka, the surname of the Kṣaharāta
chiefs Liaka Kusulaka and his son Patika Kusuluka. Analogous
to this word is the name of Kuzula Kadphises the first Kuṣāṇa
emperor to advance towards the Punjab. Hultzsch has equated
this word with Turki {%güjlü%} meaning ‘strong’, and Sten Konow
has compared it with Turki {%guzel,%} meaning ‘beautiful’, but
Lüders has shown that it is the name of a family or clan of
the Śakas.<sup>514</sup> So the name of Khosla is a remnant of this
tribe.<sup>515</sup> Besides the Thakuras and Tokhis of the Punjab,
there are caste-groups of {%Soi%} and {%Sikka,%} which are reminiscent
of the Śakas.

<L>334<pc>166<k1>सनकानीक<k2>सनकानीक
21. {%Sanakānīka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22; No. 3, L. 2):
In Inscription No. 3 it occurs with the short {%‘i’%} in the fourth
syllable, i. e. as ‘Sanakānika’.<sup>516</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sanakānīkas were also subjugated by Samudragupta
along with other tribes who payed him all kinds of taxes,
obeyed his orders and were coming to perform obeisance.<sup>517</sup>
In the Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, of the
Year 82 (A.D. 401) (No. 3), we know of a Mahārāja of the
‘Sanakānīka’ tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candra-
gupta II and who is stated to have recorded his gift on a Vaiṣ-
ṇava Cave temple at Udayagiri.<sup>518</sup> Udayagiri is a well-known
hill about two miles to the north-west of Bhilsa, ancient
Vidiśā.<sup>519</sup> Thus we can say that the Sanakānīkas lived in the
neighbourhood of Bhilsa.<sup>520</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar mentions them
to have held the province of Vidiśā but he also locates Gaṇa-
patināga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudra-
gupta) in Vidiśā.<sup>521</sup> So his view seems to be inconsistent.
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the Sanakānīka feudatory chief of
Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the
title Mahārāja. This may suggest that the Sanakānīkas, and
probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is
generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.<sup>522</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of the grandfather of this Sanakānīka feudatory
chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks
like a foreign name’;<sup>523</sup> but his father bears a purely Hindu
name: ‘Viṣṇudāsa’. Of course the present chief's name is
illegible in the inscription (No. 3).<sup>524</sup> But considering the trend
[Page-167+ 39]
it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.<sup>525</sup>
It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal
people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit
culture.
<LEND>

<L>335<pc>167<k1>वाह्लिक<k2>वाह्लिक
22. {%Vāhlika%}¦ (No. 20, L. 2):
The Meharaulī Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the {%dig-%}
{%vijaya%} of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the
first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was
inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Vaṅga count-
ries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemi-
es who, uniting together, came against him; — he, by whom,
having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river)
Sindhu, the Vāhlikas were conquered; — he, by the breezes of
whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.<sup>526</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find various readings of the name Vāhlika in literature
which are: Vāhlika, Bāhlika, Vāhlīka and Bāhlīka. In our
inscription (No. 20) {%‘Vāhlikāḥ’,%} i. e. Vāhlika in plural denotes
the people of Vāhlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on
the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.<sup>527</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mislead by a verse in the Rāmāyaṇa,<sup>528</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>529</sup>
places Vāhlikas in the close proximity of the Vipāśā, the
modern Beas. The reading {%Vāhlīkān%} in the passage quoted
from the Rāmāyaṇa is a mistake for {%Vāhīkān.%} Numerous
passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical
Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pañcanada, ‘the
land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Vāhīka
country.<sup>530</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%‘Vāhīka’%} was, in fact, a general term for the whole of
Punjab. We know Śākala as {%Vāhīka-grāma%} from Patañjali and
also {%Pātanaprastha%} which is modern Pathankot by the same
term. Moreover, Vatsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra and Rajaśekhara
in his Kāvya-mīmāṃsā mention the people of Bāhlīka and
Punjab as two separate entities. <sup>531</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is, however, one verse in the Karṇaparvan of the
Mahābhārata which suggests that Vāhīka was originally the
name of a country or people on the Vipāśā, (the Beas): “In
the Vipāśā, there were two Piśācas named {%Vahi%} and {%Hika;%}
their descendants are called Vāhīkas who are not the creation
of Prajāpati”.<sup>532</sup>
[Page-168+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the
tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the
Māhābhārata sometimes uses the terms Vāhīka, Madra, Jartika,
Āraṭṭa and Pañcanada synonymously. It appears that the lands
of these tribes which lived close to one another became in
course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful
kings of Śākala (Sialkot). As Vāhīka was beyond Kurukshetra
and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahmāvarta, its ana-
logical connection with the word {%‘bahis’%} may have been another
cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.<sup>533</sup> This is
also reflected in the Vārttikas of Katyāyana who derives the
word ‘Vāhīka’ from {%‘vahis’%} or {%‘bahis’,%} meaning ‘outside’ (the
pale of Āryandom).<sup>534</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some scholars<sup>535</sup> rely on the description of the Bāhlikas
as the offspring of two Piśācas, {%Bahi%} and {%Hika,%} as given in
the Mahābhārata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream
of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came
to be known as Bālhikas; their name which became a general
designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as
Vāhīka.<sup>536</sup> But we have already shown that the two were
separate entities.
<div n="P"/>We know that the Vāhīkas were the people living within
the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu
(Indus),<sup>537</sup> but according to the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription
Candragupta conquered Vāhlikas after crossing the seven
months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukhāni sindhoḥ).<sup>538</sup> So
Vāhlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme
north of Afghanistan.<sup>539</sup> Bajpai<sup>540</sup> opposes it on the ground
that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as
Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects
the older contention of scholars that the Kuṣāṇas were ruling
in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed
the Hindukush to crush them.
<div n="P"/>But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from
the lines in our inscription<sup>541</sup> that king Candra had conquered
the Vāhlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river
Indus.
<div n="P"/>So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that
Bālhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;<sup>542</sup> here
[Page-169+ 39]
the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the {%Mūjavants,%} the
{%Mahāvṛṣas,%} and the {%Balhikas.%} The Mūjavants are quite certainly
a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun
on Bālhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from {%bahis,%} ‘without’),<sup>543</sup>
still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern
tribe.<sup>544</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā<sup>545</sup> mentions a Kuru king named
Balhika Prātipīya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of
Pratīpa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name
Balhika.<sup>546</sup> He is perhaps the same as Mahārāja Bāhlika Prātī-
peya of the Mahābhārata.<sup>547</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rāmāyaṇa shows that the Royal Kuru family originally
migrated from the Bāhlīka country. The passage in question<sup>548</sup>
says that Ila, son of the Prajāpati Kardama, who was the king
of the Vāhli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son
Śaśavindu, and founded a new city Pratiṣṭhānapura in the
Madhya-deśa, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to
rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with
the Kardama royal family of Bāhli. H.C. Raychaudhuri<sup>549</sup>
suggests that Kārddama, the name of the ruling family of
Vāhlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia,
and thus infers that the home of the Kārddama king is to
be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was
earlier advocated by Roth<sup>550</sup> and Weber.<sup>551</sup> But Zimmer<sup>552</sup>
rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian
influence.<sup>553</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know Vāhlīka from the Puranic list of peoples<sup>554</sup> The
Account of fifty-six countries<sup>555</sup> is interesting as it mentions
them with the Hūṇas, Kauravas, Gāndhāras and Vidarbhas
among others. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra<sup>556</sup> Bāhlīka is
described as famous for horses and situated to the east of
Mahāmlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the
basis of reference in the Mahābhārata<sup>557</sup> places the Vāhlikas
in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.<sup>558</sup>
<div n="P"/>Katyāyana (4th century B.C.)<sup>559</sup> mentions Bāhlāyana and
derives it from the word Bāhli, a country also mentioned in
the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya.<sup>560</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vāyu Purāṇa, Śiva Purāṇā, Kāvya-Mīmāṃsā of Rājaśe-
khara and the Rāmāyaṇa<sup>561</sup> place the Vāhlika country in the
[Page-170+ 39]
northern division.<sup>562</sup> Bāhlika is the name of a person in the
Viṣṇu-Purāṇa.<sup>563</sup> The Nāṭyaśāstra<sup>564</sup> of Bharata says that
Bāhlikabhāṣā was spoken by the northern people (Udīcyas).
A similar reference is also to be found in the Sāhitya-darpaṇa.<sup>565</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Kāmasūtra of Vatsyāyana,<sup>566</sup> Bāhlīka is grouped
with Strīrājya, which occurs in the list of North-Western divi-
sion. The peculiar custom in Bāhlika of several young men
being married to a single woman as in {%strīrājya (strīrājye ca%}
{%Bāhlike...%}), appears to be an outlandish custom prevailing
in the regions to the west of India.<sup>567</sup> The Jayamaṅgalā comm-
entary also says that Bāhlīka was in Uttarāpatha.<sup>568</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find the word Vāhlika occurring in the Amara-kośa in
two ways:
<LEND>

<L>336<pc>170<k1>बाह्लिक<k2>बाह्लिक
1. {%Bāhlika%}¦<sup>569</sup>
<LEND>

<L>337<pc>170<k1>बाह्लीक<k2>बाह्लीक
2. {%Bāhlīka%}¦<sup>570</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Amarakośa shows that Bāhlīka was famous for horses,
saffron and Ferula Asafoetida ({%hiṅgu%}).
<div n="P"/>The reference to saffron leads us to the filaments of saffron
on the banks of Vaṅkṣu (oxus) where Raghu gave defeat to the
Hūṇas as described in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>571</sup> The reading
Sindhu of the passage<sup>572</sup> is plainly a mistake for Vaṅkśu which
is corroborated by Kṣīrasvāmin, the earliest commentator of
Amara who clearly shows that the Bāhlīka country was border-
ed on the Oxus.<sup>573</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>574</sup> places Bāhlīkas in the jurisdiction of
the Sun. Ancient tradition connects the Bāhlikas with the
Dhārṣṭakas, a Kṣatriya clan which occupied the Bāhlīka
country.<sup>575</sup> We know that Bāhlīkī was another name of Mādrī,
queen of the Madras.<sup>576</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash suggests that the Vedic school of the
{%Bhāllavins%} enshrined the memory of the Bāhlīkas; the modern
sub-castes of the Barasarin sub-group of the khatris Bhalla and
Behl represent the ancient Bālhīkas, and the Jāṭ clans of Bhālār
and Bhalerah, found in Multan, the Baloch tribe Bhalkā, liv-
ing in Sindh, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan and the clan
Bhallowana, found in Shahpur, are remnants of the far-flung
Bāhlika tribes.<sup>577</sup> There is a possibility of the Bāhlīkas migrat-
ing from their original home Balkh to the Punjab.<sup>578</sup>
<div n="P"/>When Hieun Tsang visited Balkh, it was a centre of Buddh-
[Page-171+ 40]
ist faith,<sup>579</sup> but after the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by
the Arabs, the ancient Bactria along with the adjoining territor-
ies passed under the control of Khorasan, the seat of the
Muhammadan power.<sup>580</sup>

23. {%Yaudheya%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by
Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied north-
ern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory
extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where
their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.<sup>581</sup>
Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the
Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150)<sup>582</sup>
which mentions the victory of Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman over
the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijaya-
gadh Inscription<sup>583</sup> which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in
Brāhmī characters of the second-third century A.D.)<sup>584</sup> connects
them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one
Mahārāja Mahāsenāpati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gaṇa.<sup>585</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally the word {%Yaudheya%} means ‘a warrior’ which corr-
esponds with the {%Ossadü%} of Arrian, the {%Sambastae%} of Diodorus
and the {%Sambracae%} of Curtius, who made their submission to
Alexander.<sup>586</sup> They were a powerful nation and their forces
consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.<sup>587</sup>
<div n="P"/>We get three different versions about the origin of the
Yaudheyas:
<div n="HI"/>(i) In the Mahābhārata<sup>588</sup> it is stated that Yudhiṣṭhira
married the daughter of the Śaivya King Govāsana
named Devikā and begot a son from her named
Yaudheya.
Buddha Prakash<sup>589</sup> and M.K. Sharan,<sup>590</sup> on this basis,
have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with
Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava brothers. D.K.
Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this
solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a posi-
tive evidence;<sup>591</sup> but on the other hand he himself has
indulged in connecting the Ārjunāyanas with the epic
hero Arjuna.<sup>592</sup>
<div n="P"/>(ii) The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa gives a contrary view of the same
story. It states that {%Yaudheyī%} was the queen of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira from whom he had a son named Devaka<sup>593</sup>
[Page-172+ 39]
<div n="HI"/>(iii) The Harivaṃśa<sup>594</sup> and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>595</sup> state that
King Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty had five queens
named Nṛgā or Mṛgā, Kṛmī, Navā, Darvā and Dṛṣad-
vatī who gave birth to five sons named Nṛga, (or Mṛga),
Kṛmi, Nava, Suvrata and Śibi (or Śivi) respectively.
Śibi was the lord of the Śibi people or of the city of
Śivapura, while Nṛga (or Mṛga) was the ruler of the
Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons
of Uśīnara, viz., Nava, Kṛmi and Suvrata, were the
lords respectively of Navarāṣṭra, Kṛmilāpurī and Amba-
ṣṭhapurī.<sup>596</sup> According to Pargiter, King Uśinara
established the Yaudheyas, Ambaṣṭhas, Navarāṣṭra, and
the city of Kṛmilā, all on the eastern border of the
Punjab; while his famous son Śivi Auśīnara originated
the Śivis or Śrbis in Sivapura.<sup>597</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition
without any further evidence. However, as regards their conne-
ction with Uśīnara, we may say that scholars are somewhat
confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the
territory ruled over by him.<sup>598</sup> The Ṛgveda, the Jātakas as
well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the
Uśīnaras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley,
a part of the ancient Mahājanapada of Gandhāra; while the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, the Kauśītakī Upaniṣad and the Kathāsa-
ritsāgara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near
the source of Ganges at Kanakhala.
<div n="P"/>It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat
Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places
as well. For example, we find that the Śibis were known to
Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the
Akesines (Chenab).<sup>599</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mahābhārata,<sup>600</sup> the Yaudheyas are described as
having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Mālavas and
Trigarttas. In the Sabhāparvan,<sup>601</sup> the Yaudheyas together
with the Śibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having
paid homage to Yudhiṣṭhira. In the Droṇaparvan,<sup>602</sup> we find
that an epithet {%‘Adrija’%} meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for
the Yaudheyas.
<div n="P"/>The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the
[Page-173+ 39]
Punjab. Pāṇini<sup>603</sup> includes them among the {%āyudhajīvī saṃghas%}
together with the Parśus who are considered to be Persians
by Dr. Buddha Prakash.<sup>604</sup> Pāṇini mentions the Yaudheyas in
another Sūtra also.<sup>605</sup> Kauṭilya also refers to the Yaudheya as
a warrior clan of the Punjab.<sup>606</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>607</sup> places them in the northern division of
India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.<sup>608</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Sāhityadarpaṇa of Viśvanātha, they are described as
interested in gambling ({%dīvyatām%}) and speaking the Southern
Vaidarbhī.<sup>609</sup>
<div n="P"/>Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from
Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been
unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds
was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak
where there seems to have existed a regular mint.<sup>610</sup> Their
new currency<sup>611</sup> depicting their tutelary deity Kārttikeya which
replaced the Kuṣāṇa currency in these regions, shows that
they played a leading part in the extermination of Śaka rule
in India.<sup>612</sup> The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large num-
ber at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra
attest the fact that they had driven out the Kuṣāṇas from these
areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th
century A.D.<sup>613</sup>
<div n="P"/>One of their seals, bearing the legend {%“Yaudheyānām jayam-%}
{%antradharāṇām”%}<sup>614</sup> shows that they were held in high esteem
among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem
to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji<sup>615</sup>
opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gaṇa as
well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan<sup>616</sup> explains the word
{%“Mantradhara”%} to mean the members of the Executive Com-
mittee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the
opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the
name of the {%“Mantradharas”%} and the {%“Gaṇa”,%} while the other
set is struck simply in the name of Gaṇa.<sup>617</sup> He seems to have
wrongly substituted the reading {%“Mantradhāra”%} for {%“Mantra-%}
{%dhara”.%} He has been arbitrary in separating {%“Jaya”%} from
{%Mantradharāṇām%}”<sup>618</sup> which forms a compound by the combi-
nation of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some
historians who consider the word {%“Mantradharāṇām”%} to mean
[Page-174+ 39]
‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he
contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal<sup>619</sup>
found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates
the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as
they had adopted the title of {#‘जयमन्त्रधराः’#}”.
<div n="P"/>Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who
knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and
pride that they never got defeated.
<div n="P"/>Another word which has raised some controversy among
the scholars is {%“Darma”%} found on some of the Yaudheya coins.
Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for
{%‘Dama’%} or {%‘Darma’%} to be a Sanskritised form of Greek —
{%“Drachma”.%}<sup>620</sup> Again some controversy arose whether it was
a Copper one or of silver.<sup>621</sup> The word {%‘Damma’%} or {%‘Dramma’%}
has been used for a gold coin.<sup>622</sup> It may be remarked that the
word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly
be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean
coin.<sup>623</sup> The Kuṣāṇas had introduced gold-coins which were
later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to
have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found
no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker
economic condition; surely they could not compare with
powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have
the mysterious words, {%“dvi”%} (two) and {%“tri”%} (three) after the
legend {%“Yaudheyagaṇasya jayaḥ”%} which may point out their
making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the Ārjunāyanas
and the Kuṇindas.<sup>624</sup> They seem to have controlled the area
lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the
Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word
{%‘Johiya’%} is apparently an abbreviation of {%‘Jodhiya’,%} which is the
Sanskrit Yaudheya.<sup>625</sup> Cunningham, however, takes the words
{%‘dvi’%} and {%‘tri’%} of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the
money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.<sup>626</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.K. Sharan<sup>627</sup> has enlisted about twenty-four types and
Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to
their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their
social life. They are as follows:
<div n="P"/>1. Bull
<div n="P"/>2. Elephant
[Page-175+ 24]

<H>CONCLUSION
We have discussed the following names of the tribes:
<P>1. Ābhīra
<P>2. Ārjunāyanas
<P>3. Āṭavikas
<P>4. Daivaputra
<P>5. Hūṇa
<P>6. Kākas
<P>7. Kharaparikas
<P>8. Kotas
<P>9. Kurus
<P>10. Licchavis
<P>11. Madrakas
<P>12. Mālava
<P>13. Mleccha
<P>14. Muruṇḍas
<P>15. Prārjunas
<P>16. Puṣyamitras
<P>17. Ṣāhānuṣāhi
<P>18. Ṣāhi
<P>19. Saiṃhalaka
<P>20. Śaka
<P>21. Sanakānīka
<P>22. Vāhlīka
<P>23. Yaudheya
<P>Among these the Ābhīra, Ārjunāyanas, Āṭavikas, Kākas,
Kharaparikas, Kotas, Kurus, Licchavis, Madrakas, Mālava,
Prārjunas, Puṣyamitras, Sanakānīkas and Yaudheyas are the
indigenous tribes while the Daivaputra, Hūṇa, Mleccha,
Muruṇḍas, Ṣāhānuṣāhi, Ṣāhi, Saiṃhalaka, Śaka, and Vāhlīka
represent the foreign stock.
<P>We have seen how some of these tribes migrated to places
other than their original settlements and gave their names to
[Page-177+ 39]
the janapadas they settled. They replaced the old Vedic tribes
in Punjab and Rajasthan though some of them are deemed as
offshoots of the main tribe. The Prārjunas, Sanakānīkas,
Kākas and Kharaparikas may be later tribes since they find
hardly any mention in the ancient texts. The Madrakas who
were a branch of the Śālvas (who had a totemic origin) and
the Licchavis who had legendary origin as a result of an
incestuous union between brother and sister may even be pre-
dated to Āryan way of life, indicating the period of totemic
worship and when there was no conscious taboo on incest.
About the foreign tribes mentioned above we find that the
Śakas influenced India so much that the Purāṇa-writers included
{%Śaka-dvīpa%} in the Bhuvanakośa section. There are probabilities
of the Hūṇa and Vāhlīka settlements in the Punjab and some
territories known after them. The title Ṣāhi was supplanted by
the Hūṇas and Turks in their administrative systems. After the
Āryans migrated to the east, the lands in the North-West were
looked at with contempt, by the easterners and were labelled
as the Mleccha lands. The term Mleccha was generally used
for the foreigners who did not come under the pale of Āryandom.
Hence the people in the North-West who came under foreign
influence and were liberalized in their outlook, were also
terms as the Mlecchas. Thus we find that the process of
political and the ethnic transformation continued.
<P>Not only that we find that the majority of the above-
mentioned tribes were Āryanized, some under the Vrātya
variety while others under the {%Vṛṣala%} system. The Hūṇas and
the Śakas were admitted to the Kṣatriya stock while the Śaka-
brāhmaṇas known as the Magas were brahmanised. Many pre-
Āryan names were Sanskritized but some names retained their
old forms; the names like the Licchavis, Ābhīra, etc., cannot
be explained through the root and suffix of Āryan language.<sup>629</sup>
<P>Thus we see that the ethnic, geographical and cultural
factors differentiated one tribe from the other. The use of the
terms Ārya, Anārya, Mleccha, Vrātya and Vṛṣala prove it
beyond doubt. But there was interaction among these tribes
and the tribes which interacted later survived as castes. Most
of these tribes represented the Little Tradition and were
absorbed into the Great Tradition. Some of their cults and their
[Page-178+ 38]
gods became a part of the main-stream of the Āryan society.
<P>The Linguistic Survey of India has shown a survival of
India's {%janapadas%} through the long periods of time. The areas
of Indian dialects and languages as they are found today
correspond, in a striking manner, to the ancient or medieval
{%janapadas%} or {%janapada-saṃghātas%} (federations of {%Janapadas%}).
Even the Janapadas of the {%mahā-Janapadas%} of the sixth century
B.C. comprised small areas. ‘The ancients were not great
conquerors’ declared Bāṇa, an author of the seventh century
A.D., ‘for in a small area of land, they had number of kings’.<sup>630</sup>
By the close of the Gupta period, however, the {%Janapadas%}
had grown sufficiently in size, and in the middle ages they
came to be almost what we find them today.<sup>631</sup>
<P>It may also be conceded that the gaṇa states of the
Yaudheyas, Mālavas and Licchavis were not democracies or
republics in the sense in which we understand these words
today. Supreme and ultimate power did not lie vested in the
whole body of adult citizens. We can still describe these states
as republics. Standard works and authorities on the political
science define republic as a state, where the sovereign power
vests, not in a single person as in monarchy, but in a group or
college of persons, more or less numerous. Oligarchies, aristo-
cracies, and democracies have all been labelled as republics.<sup>632</sup>
<P>In any case modern India may take legitimate pride in the
fact that, though she may not have had democracies in the
modern sense, government by discussion was by no means
unknown in her ancient civilization.<sup>633</sup>
<P>Finally we may say that Samudragupta did not destroy the
Mālavas, Ārjunayānas, the Yaudheyas and the Madras to
extinction; they had become tributary but retained their internal
autonomy. Their territories were never directly administered
by the Guptas, and so their republican institutions could not
have been much affected.

<P>Medhātithi and Govindarāja, the two earliest commentators of the
Manu-smṛti-read Licchavi and this reading tallies exactly with the name
as given by Kauṭilya. Therefore, this form represents the earliest spelling
of this word in the Brahmanical Sanskrit literature. It is only Kullūka
Bhaṭṭa, the Bengali Commentator of the fifteenth century, who reads
Nicchivi in a verse of Manu (X. 22). This was due to a confusion between
{%‘la’%} and {%‘na’%} of the fifteenth century in the Bengali language. Moreover,
these letters are frequently inter-changed in our tongues as we know
from our common experience.

Jagannath in his article ‘The Puṣyamitras of Bhitari Pillar Inscription’ —
JJ. Vol. 22, No. 4, Dec. 1946, p. 112, writes:
<P>“I have myself examined the inscription on the original stone, and
in my opinion while the first syllable may be {%‘pu’%} or {%‘yu’%}, the next
syllable can not be {%‘dhya’.%}
<P>Over the subscript {%‘y’%} there are clear traces of a square form. It is not
cylindrical, in shape, as would be the form of {%‘dh’.%} It can only be {%‘p’%} or
{%‘s’.%} But as {%‘p’%} makes an impossible word {%‘pupya’%} the choice is evidently
restricted to {%‘s’%} and we get {%‘puṣya’.%} Mr. Divekar's suggestion is thus
disposed of.
<P>We also know of the early king Puṣyamitra Śuṅga, a brāhmaṇa,
general of Bṛhadratha the Mauryan king who was a contemporary of
Patañjali (Fleet, (Dx)<sup>1</sup> p. 55, note 2) which bears out the Prakrit form
‘Pūsamitta’ in the passages given by Dr. Bühler from the Prakrit Gāthās

[Page-203+ 34]
<H>Prologue
<P>“Place-names have an abiding interest: historical geographi-
cal, linguistic, and above all, human. They may tell us how
our ancestors lived, and how they looked on life. Place-names
may be picturesque, even poetical, or they may be pedestrian,
even trivial. All are worthy of observation.”<sup>1</sup>
<P>Their study needs serious scientific investigation. Every
available recorded form must be studied minutely and an ex-
tensive knowledge of many languages and dialects may be
required. Names of cities, castles, countries, towns, villages,
hamlets, roads, lanes, footpaths, mountains, hills, islands, fields,
forests, rivers, lakes and streams can provide us with a wealth
of information about local history, geography, dialects and
phonetic features. We should arrange the recorded forms in a
chronological order and study them keeping in view the similar
instances. We should study the place names by the following
process:
<P>(i) The initial terms and their significance,
<P>(ii) The suffixes and their significance,
<P>(iii) Synthesis of the above results.
<P>By such study of place-names we can peep into the cul-
ture of the past and compare it with the existing culture.
<P>Countries, towns, mountains and rivers are generally
named after discoverers, conquerors, founders and celebrated
men. We must also keep in view the situation of a place, its
surroundings and inhabitants.
<P>The study of place names has received considerable atten-
tion in Western countries specially in Scandinavia, England
and America.
<P>In England the scientific investigation of local nomencla-
ture began in the year 1901 when Walter William Skeat's book
{%The place-names of Cambridgeshire%} was published. Skeat
was constantly stimulated and encouraged by the erudite
scholar Henry Bradley. Skeat and Bradley with Sir Allen
[Page-204+ 39]
Mawer founded in 1923 an English Place-name Society under
the patronage of the British Academy. Scholars, archivists,
librarians, curators, teachers, students and people from other
professions have gladly helped in the work of the society and as
the country surveys have appeared year by year, notable addi-
tions have been made to the knowledge of local archaeology,
history and geography, of regional dialects, past and present.<sup>2</sup>
<P>In India<sup>3</sup>, S.K. Chatterji<sup>4</sup>, Sefti Pillar<sup>5</sup>, Krishnapada Gos-
wami<sup>6</sup>, Bhayani<sup>7</sup> and Sandesara<sup>8</sup> have made the studies in this
direction.
<P>H.D. Sankalia<sup>9</sup> classifies the place-names into the following
groups:
<P>I. Place-names after a person, deity, spirit or tribe.
<P>(i) Place-names after a person — -hero, saint, tribal leader
<P>(ii) Place-names after a deity
<P>(iii) Place-names after a sptrit
<P>(iv) Place-names after tribes or peoples
<P>II. Place-names after an event — auspicious occasion, bad
occasion.
<P>III. Place-names after customs and superstitions.
<P>IV. Place-names after geographical and physical features:
(i) Place-names after hills, mountains, mounds or any
elevated place
<P>(ii) Place-names after rivers, streams, lakes and ponds,
<P>(iii) Place-names after forests, deserts, steppes, etc.
<P>V. Place-names after animals, birds and reptiles:
<P>(i) Animals
<P>(ii) Birds
<P>(iii) Reptiles
<P>VI. Place-names after names of existing places.
Chatterji<sup>10</sup> would suggest the following classification:
<P>(i) Place-names from tribes or castes living there originally.
<P>(ii) Place-names from names of natural features.
<P>(iii) Place-names of a religious character.
<P>(iv) Place-names after names of persons or events.
<P>(v) Place-names copied from other place-names.
<P>Actually both the classifications mean the same thing and
represent the general trends of naming the places. Dr. Sankalia
seems to have just simplified and annotated Dr. Chatterji's
[Page-205+ 39]
classification.
<P>It may be pointed out that tradition, particularly as recor-
ded in the Epics and Purāṇas ascribes the foundation of cities
to particular kings, who are often believed to have given their
name to the respective cities but sometimes it remains in-
consistent with the original statements. This may indicate that
sometimes it was thought that cities could be founded only
by kings; no other factor was envisaged to be responsible for
the expansion of urbanism — a belief which ignores the inter-
play of variables that went into the making of cities.<sup>11</sup>
<P>“The analysis which Pāṇini gives of the underlying mean-
ings which relate place-names to human society, shows conclu-
sively that place-names do not originate by mere accident, but
are the outcome of social and historical conditions with which
a community is intimately connected. An etymological app-
roach to the place-names of a country, therefore, introduces us
to many a forgotten chapter of history and ethnography.”<sup>12</sup>
<P>But Pāṇini<sup>13</sup> also cautions his readers that the etymological
meaning of place-names should not be held authoritative since
the name should vanish when the people leave the place who
gave their name to it.
<P>Pāṇini<sup>14</sup> gives the following ending of place-names:
<P>1. Nagara (IV. 2. 142)
<P>2. Pura (IV. 2. 122)
<P>3. Grāma (IV. 2. 142)
<P>4. Kheṭa (VI 2. 126)
<P>5. Ghoṣa (VI. 2. 85)
<P>(6-9) Kūla, Sūda, Sthala, Karṣa (VI 2. 129)
<P>(10-11) Tīra, Rūpya (VI. 1. 135)
<P>(12-15) Kaccha, Agni, Vaktra, Garta (VI. 2. 126)
<P>(16) Palada (IV. 2. 142)
<P>(17) Arma (VI. 2. 90)
<P>(18) Vaha (IV. 2. 122)
<P>(19) Hrada (IV. 2. 142)
<P>(20) Prastha (IV. 2. 122, IV. 2. 110)
<P>(21) Kanthā (IV. 2. 142)
<P>Pāṇini gives the interesting information that the ending
kanthā was in use in Uśīnara (11. 4.20) and Varṇu (Bannu)
(IV. 2.103). Kanthā was a Śaka word for a town as in expression
[Page-206+ 39]
Kandāvara-Kanthāvara occurring in a Kharoṣṭhī inscription.<sup>15</sup>
<P>There are also instances when place-names have been very
lengthy.<sup>16</sup>
<P>1. The longest place-name in Great Britain has 58 letters —
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogercychwyrndrobw Hllantsysiliogo-
gogoch — a railway station on the Holyhead-Euston
line.<sup>17</sup>
<P>2. Kardivilliwarrakurrakurrieapparlarndoo<sup>18</sup> —
This is not a misprint. It is an Australian aboriginal
word. It is the name of a lake in the Northern territory,
and it means ‘the stralight shining on the waters of the
lake’.<sup>19</sup>
<P>Modern place-names suffixes and prefixes may be divided
into three main categories.
<HI>(i) Endings with Sanskrit influence — Pura, Purā, Nagara,
Koṭa, Thala (Sthala), Kuṇḍa, Pokhrā, Pāḍā, Bāḍī, etc.
<HI>(ii) Endings with Persian-Arabic influence: — Tālāba, Gañja,
(Nawabganj, Daraganja, Vishveshwaraganja), Chaka.
<HI>(iii) Vernacular terms added before: Ḍerā, Mohalla,
Basti, etc.
<HI>(iv) English-Colony, town, street, Road, Fountain, Sector,
Block, Enclave, Gate, Bridge, Place and Cantt. (Can-
tonment).
<P>According to the Mahābhārata<sup>20</sup>, ‘a place must be named
after any of its peculiar features’.
<P>In the Mahābhārata<sup>21</sup> {%‘Janapada’ ‘Deśa’%} and {%Rāṣṭra%} are used
synonymously.<sup>22</sup> Yet in practice, they must differ slightly.
‘Deśa’ means ‘a country’, province or any patch of land’, ‘Jana-
pada’, a tribal settlement,<sup>23</sup> whereas ‘Rāṣṭra’ is definitely a
political term, denoting ‘whatever fell under the jurisdiction
of the sovereignty’.
<P>It will be interesting to note the antiquity of place-name
terms. We find Rāṣṭra<sup>24</sup> as the oldest right from the Ṛgveda,
and used for the biggest unit. Its equivalent Janapada came
into being in the Brāhmaṇa-period.<sup>25</sup> The Ṛgveda frequently
refers to tribes viz. the Yadus, the Purus, the Anus etc. who
were residing in particular area without mentioning their terri-
tory, province or kingdom.<sup>26</sup> The ordinary people of a Jana-
pada were called {%Viś%} which were divided into {%grāmas%} or unions
[Page-207+ 37]
of many families. So whenever the people of {%grāmas%} settled they
were termed as {%grāmas%} (villages) and hence the word {%Saṃgrāma%}
came into being when a number of {%grāmas%} united for a battle.
Every Janapada had a {%pura%} or chief city (capital) where the
king resided. Every Janapada was politically named as Rāṣṭra.<sup>27</sup>
Pāṇini mentions a number of Janapadas in the Aṣṭādhyāyī.<sup>28</sup>
Kauṭilya also uses the term Janapada for territory as the con-
stituent of State.<sup>29</sup> We find the mention of sixteen Mahājanapadas
of Āryāvarta in many places in the Buddhist literature. The
term {%‘rājya’%} with its different kinds is referred to in the later
Vedic period i. e. in the Brāhmaṇas.
<P>Later on we find that the connotations of the territorial
units differed from place to place and time to time. Pāṇini men-
tions separately the villages and towns of Eastern India ({%Prācām%}
{%grāmanagarāṇām,%} VII. 3. 14), but with reference to Vāhīka and
Udīcya country he uses the term grāma in a generic sense to
include all centres of population (IV. 2. 117 and IV. 2. 109).
Patañjali in commenting on the distinctions between the terms
{%grāma%} and {%pura%} remarks that these should not be settled by rules
of grammar but by local usage ({%tatrātinirbandho na lābhaḥ,%}
III. 321).
<P>The two terms {%grāma%} and {%nagara%} were used indiscriminately
in the Vāhīka country (Punjab) where the villages had also
grown in prosperity like the towns, and hence the word grāma
here included nagara also in the connotation.<sup>30</sup>
<P>Yajñavalkya<sup>31</sup> uses the term {%Pūga%} which the Mitākṣarā
explains as the assembly of the inhabitants of the same place
with different castes and occupations such as village, city etc.
<P>The {%Amarakośa%} gives the following words as synonymous,
all standing for town or city: {%pur, purī, nagarī, pattana, puṭa-%}
{%bhedana, sthānīya%} and {%nigama.%}<sup>32</sup> It also differentiates the
{%Mūlanagara%} (main city) from the {%Sākhā-nagara%} (branch
town).<sup>33</sup>

 {%Rāṣṭra<sup>1</sup>%}¦ (from §rāj):
<div n="P"/>It is the oldest and biggest territorial term. In the Ṛgveda<sup>2</sup>
and later Saṃhitās,<sup>3</sup> it denotes ‘kingdom’ or ‘royal territory’.
It is considered to be one of the Prakṛtis (constituents)<sup>4</sup> and
refers to a country.<sup>5</sup> It was the name of a Commissioner's
division under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas.<sup>6</sup> In South India, under the
Pallavas, Kadambas, and Sālaṅkāyanas also it denotes only
a district, if not a tehsil.<sup>7</sup> The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra<sup>8</sup> says
that ‘all the rāṣṭra including {%nagara%} is called {%deśa%} or {%maṇḍala%}
while nagara is excluded in janapada’.
<div n="P"/>It divides rāṣṭras into three kinds: —
<div n="P"/>(i) Big: It consists of nine thousand and ninety villages,
but some scholars say that the nine thousand and sixty
four villages make a big rāṣṭra.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>(ii) Middle: It consists of five thousand, three hundred and
eighty four villages.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>(iii) Small: It consists of one thousand, five hundred and
forty eight villages.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>It further discusses that seven cities should be established
in each rāṣṭra.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>In place-names rāṣṭra is changed into:<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Rāṭhā, as Mahārāṣṭra, Marāṭhā
<div n="P"/>(b) Rāṭ, at Mayarāṣṭra, (= Mayarāṭ), Mirāṭ
<div n="P"/>It also changes into raṭṭa,
<div n="P"/>Cf. Nāgiraṭṭa. Walde also derives it
from §rāj-(n. sg. rāṭ)
<div n="P"/>Sk. {%rāṣṭra:%} AV. {%rāstar — ,<sup>14</sup>%}
[Page-210+ 39]
<div n="P"/>In ancient Indian history extending over several centuries,
we do not find uniformity in the nomenclature of the different
territorial and administrative divisions in the various kingdoms
flourishing in different centuries and provinces. In the small
kingdoms like those of the Pallavas, the Vākāṭakas and
Gāhaḍavālas we usually find reference to only one territorial
division, the district variously called {%viṣaya%} or {%rāṣṭra.<sup>15</sup>%}
<div n="P"/>Following are the names with this ending:
<LEND>

<L>340<pc>210<k1>देवराष्ट्र<k2>देवराष्ट्र
1. {%Devarāṣṭra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 20):
<div n="P"/>It has been mentioned as ruled by Kubera one of the kings
ruling in Southern Region who were subdued by Samudragupta.
Dey<sup>16</sup> identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Mahārāṣṭra).
Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas
slightly differs from them when he identifies Devarāṣṭra with
modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.<sup>17</sup> According to R.D.
Banerjee<sup>18</sup> Devarāṣṭra is the name of a district or province in
Kaliṅga. B.C. Law<sup>19</sup> identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of
the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Ray-
chaudhuri,<sup>20</sup> S.B. Chaudhuri,<sup>21</sup> Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.<sup>22</sup> This
view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that
Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the
eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious
difficulties about his potential relations with the Vākāṭakas.
Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta
as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent
that Devarāṣṭra was conterminous with Kośala (Sirpur). Tām-
ralipti may have been included in Devarāṣṭra.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):
<div n="P"/>L. 2 of the inscription mentions a maṇḍala (sub-division) called
Nāgiraṭṭa (Nāgiraṭṭa-māṇḍalika) and later on refers to Mūla-
Nāgiraṭṭa which seems to have been the headquarters of this
maṇḍala. It is clear from the inscription itself that Mūla-
Nāgiraṭṭa was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Gohālī.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa literally means ‘Nāgiraṭṭa Proper’. The
word Nāgiraṭṭa is the Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra meaning ‘a
country of the Nāgas’.
<LEND>

<L>341<pc>210<k1>सुराष्ट्र<k2>सुराष्ट्र
3. {%Surāṣṭra%}¦ (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9):
In L. 8 Surāṣṭra is used in plural<sup>25</sup> while in L. 9 it is an adjective
of {%avani%} (land).<sup>26</sup> In this inscription great importance has been
[Page-211+ 37]
attached to Surāṣṭra. After his conquests, Skandagupta
deliberated for days and nights together as to whom should be
entrusted important task of guarding the land of the Surāṣṭras.<sup>27</sup>
At last he was satisfied by appointing Parṇadatta as a governor
over this western<sup>28</sup> region.
<div n="P"/>Surāṣṭra corresponds with Southern Kathiawar with its
Prakrit name Soraṭh.<sup>29</sup> Literally the name means a good
country. It was so named probably on account of the natural
fertility of the land, Soraṭh is well known for rich crops of all
kinds, and splendid cattle.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>Surāṣṭra<sup>31</sup> is mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription
of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150). It was governed by Puṣyagupta,
under Candragupta Maurya and by a Yavana Tuṣāspa under
Aśoka.<sup>32</sup> The Purāṇas<sup>33</sup> and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā<sup>34</sup> mention it
a country in the west while the Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>35</sup> mentions it
as a country in the South. It may be due to the different
geographical units made by the authors of the Kāvyamīmāṃsā
and the Bṛhatsaṃhitā.
<div n="P"/>Under Gupta emperors Bāmanasthalī (modern Banthali) was
the capital of Surāṣṭra, before Valabhī became its capital.<sup>36</sup>
The name Surāṣṭra also occurs in the Mahābhārata, the
Jātakas<sup>37</sup>, and several times in the Rāmāyaṇa.<sup>38</sup> It is also
mentioned in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya.<sup>39</sup> In Kauṭilya's Arthaśās-
tra, Surāṣṭras are mentioned as one of the corporations of
warriors who lived by agriculture and trade.<sup>40</sup> According to
the Arthaśāstra the elephants of Surāṣṭra were inferior to those
belonging to Aṅga and Kaliṅga.<sup>41</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the medieval period,<sup>42</sup> in three directions, Bhavanagar,
Porabandar and Somanath (the famous temple) were the limits
of Surāṣṭra.
<div n="P"/>{%Place-names ending in Bhukti%}
<LEND>

<L>342<pc>211<k1>भुक्ति<k2>भुक्ति
 {%Bhukti%}¦ (from §bhuj)
<div n="P"/>Literally it means ‘enjoyment’ or possession.<sup>43</sup> Bhukti
denoted an administrative division smaller than a modern
Tehsil or Taluka in the Deccan and M.P., but in Northern
India under the Guptas and Pratihāras it denoted a unit as
large as the Commissioner's Division in modern times.<sup>44</sup> Thus
[Page-212+ 39]
Pratiṣṭhānabhukti consisted of only 12 and Koppārakabhukti
of 50 villages in the Deccan under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas,<sup>45</sup> whereas
under the Guptas the Puṇḍravardhanabhukti comprised of the
districts of Dinajpur, Bogra and Rajshahi, and Magadhabhukti
included the districts of Gayā and Pāṭaliputra.<sup>46</sup> Śrāvastibhukti
under the Pratihāras included several districts in northern
U.P.<sup>47</sup> The Bhuktis under the Pratihāra empire appear to have
been rather Commissioners' Divisions than provinces.<sup>48</sup> Bhukti
is changed into huti as Jejakabhukti, Jejahuti.<sup>49</sup> The unit bhukti
which so often appears in the inscriptions of the Gupta period
as the designation of an administrative unit is not frequently
found in the early medieval period.<sup>50</sup> The mention of a
Nagara-bhukti is also made in Deo-Baranark Inscription of
Jīvitagupta II.<sup>51</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find only one place name with the suffix {%bhukti%} which
is detailed below:
<div n="P"/>{%Puṇḍravardhana%} (No. 28, L. 1; No. 33, LL. 1-2; No. 34,
L. 2; No. 35, L. 2; No. 36, L. 2; No. 37, L. 2; No. 43,
L. 14):
<div n="P"/>This bhukti is mentioned in the Gupta epigraphs ranging
from the years 124 to 224 of the Gupta era, i. e. from A.D. 443
to 543. It formed an integral part of Gupta empire during this
period. According to Inscription No. 37, a noble man (kula-
putra) Amṛtadeva by name belonging to Ayodhyā approached
the local government of Koṭivarṣa of which Svyambhudeva
was the governor, under the provincial government of Puṇḍra-
vardhana-bhukti, during the reign of Bhānugupta, and prayed
that he might be given, by means of a copper-plate document
in accordance with the prevailing custom, some rent-free
waste lands. His prayer was granted.
<div n="P"/>General Cunningham<sup>52</sup> identifies Puṇḍravardhana with the
extensive ruins known as ‘Mahāsthāngarh’, 8 miles north of
the town of Bogra. The river Karatoyā was the dividing line
between Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti and Kāmarūpa.<sup>53</sup> According
to Wilson, the ancient kingdom of Puṇḍradeśa included the
districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Bogra and
Tirhut.<sup>54</sup> It seems to have been the biggest administrative
division or province of the Gupta empire, divided into several
viṣayas and maṇḍalas of which twenty-four<sup>55</sup> are mentioned
[Page-213+ 38]
in known epigraphs. In short Puṇḍravardhana signified North
Bengal.
<div n="P"/>Puṇḍravardhana, as the name suggests, was a settlement of
the Puṇḍras.<sup>56</sup> The first reference to the Puṇḍras is found in
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>57</sup> The earliest literary reference to
Puṇḍravardhana is to be traced in the Buddhist work, the
Divyāvadāna, where it is mentioned as the easternmost city of
India.<sup>58</sup> The Pauṇḍra country is mentioned also in the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā,<sup>59</sup> as situated in the east.<sup>60</sup> The Kāvyamīṃāṃsā also
mentions it as a Janapada in the east. In the inscriptions of
Bengal the name Puṇḍravardhana was changed into Pauṇḍra-
vardhana in the early part of the 12th century, when it occurs
first in the Manahali grant of Madanapāla and remained in use
till the end of the Sena rule. The Rājataraṅgiṇī mentions
Puṇḍravardhana as the capital of Gauḍa which is also proved
by a reference in Puruṣottama's lexicon (11th century A.D.)<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city lost its importance from the third quarter of the
12th century A.D. as the later Sena kings shifted their capital
to Gauḍa in the Malda district. Towards the end of the 13th
or the beginning of the 14th century A.D. Puṇḍravardhana was
occupied by the Muhammedans.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Place-names ending in Viṣaya%}
<LEND>

<L>343<pc>213<k1>विषय<k2>विषय
 {%Viṣaya%}¦
According to Monier Williams it means a dominion, king-
dom, territory, region, district, country, or abode and in plural
it meant lands or possessions.<sup>63</sup> In the Aṣṭādhyāyī<sup>64</sup> it denotes
regions or provinces, called after their inhabitants, e. g. Śaiba,
the region of the Śibis; Mālavaka, the region of the Mālava
people; Rājanyaka, of the Rājanya tribe and so forth. ‘The
names according to Viṣaya seem to be based on the ethnic
distribution of population over particular areas for the time
being without reference to the form of government’.<sup>65</sup>
<div n="P"/>The word Viṣaya in the sūtra Viṣayo deśe<sup>66</sup> is significant.
Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana and Hemacandra take it as rāṣṭra, and
Vardhamāna as Janapada. The Kāśikā takes it as grāma-samu-
dāya. Kātayāyana and Patañjali interpret Viṣaya as being
identical with janapada in some cases, but their comments
give the impression that even such geographical units as were
[Page-214+ 39]
not a janapada were called Viṣaya.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>If Viṣaya and Janapada had been identical, Pāṇini would
not have treated the former under a separate heading.<sup>68</sup> A
Viṣaya denoted both a bigger unit having the status of a
Janapada, and a smaller area which was but an estate. In the
Rājanyādi gaṇa, viṣaya denotes janapadas, while in the
Bhauriki and Aiṣukāri gaṇas,<sup>69</sup> it is landed property, the share
of estate which was the source of livelihood.
<div n="P"/>In the post-pāṇinian period, distinction between Janapada
and viṣaya was lost, both being called by the same names, for
example Aṅgāḥ, Vangāḥ, Sumhāḥ, and Puṇḍrāḥ. In some Jana-
padas like Rājanya, the distinction was retained, as Rājanyaka
denoted a viṣaya and Rājanyāḥ, the Janapada of the Rājanya
tribe. Similarly we have Vāsātaḥ, Vāsātayaḥ; Gandhāraḥ,
Gāndhārayaḥ; and Śaibaḥ, Śibiyaḥ. Other smaller units were
only viṣayas or estates like Bailvavanaka, Ātmakāmeyaka,
Bhaurikavidha and Aiṣukāri-bhakta.<sup>70</sup>
<div n="P"/>The viṣaya usually corresponded with the district of the
modern administration.<sup>71</sup> Minor bhuktis, maṇḍalas and the
viṣayas were used to denote the same administrative division
in many cases.<sup>72</sup> The district administration was well organised
in the Gupta period. Some of the land-grant charters bear the
seals of the district administration.<sup>73</sup> Sealings of the district
administration of Rājagṛha and Gayā have been found at
Nālandā, showing that their correspondence to outsiders bore
the impress of their official seals.<sup>74</sup>
<div n="P"/>We have the following place-names ending in Viṣaya:
<LEND>

<L>344<pc>214<k1>गया<k2>गया
1. {%Gayā%}¦ (No. 21, L. 7):
<div n="P"/>A village named Revatikā belonging to the Gayā viṣaya
was granted as an agrahāra to a brāhmaṇa, ostensibly by
Samudragupta.<sup>75</sup> Gayā is at present headquarters of the
Gayā district, 60 miles due south of Patna. It comprises the
modern town of Sahebganj on the northern side and the
ancient town of Gayā on the southern side.<sup>76</sup> Much has been
written on Gayā,<sup>77</sup> all of which is not possible to discuss
here. We will confine ourselves to the origin of the name Gayā
and the importance of Gayā.
<div n="P"/>In the Ṛgveda Gaya is a proper name applied to a com-
poser of hymns.<sup>78</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>79</sup> Gaya appears to be a
[Page-215+ 39]
wonder-worder or sorcerer along with Asita and Kaśyapa who
later on transformed himself into Gayāsura.<sup>80</sup> According to
the Vāyu Purāṇa,<sup>81</sup> the city was named Gaya after an Asura,
Gaya by name (Gayāsura). Viṣṇu killed this demon but
granted him a boon that this city would be held highly sacred.
According to R.L. Mitra,<sup>82</sup> this story is an allegorical repre-
sentation of the expulsion of Buddhism from Gayā which
was the headquarters of the Buddhist faith. Aurṇavābha in ex-
plaining ‘idam Viṣṇur-vī Cakrame tredhā nidadhe padam’<sup>83</sup>
in the Nirukta<sup>84</sup> holds that the three steps of Viṣṇu were placed
on Samārohaṇa, Viṣṇupada and Gayaśiras. The Māhabhārata
(III. 95 and VII. 64) describes the performance of sacrifices by
Gaya<sup>85</sup> references to which<sup>86</sup> are also found in the Rāmā-
yaṇa,<sup>87</sup> Bhāgavata Purāṇa<sup>88</sup> Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,<sup>89</sup> Agni
Purāṇa,<sup>90</sup> Viṣṇu Purāṇa,<sup>91</sup> Vāmana Purāṇa,<sup>92</sup> etc. Aśvaghoṣa's
Buddhacarita<sup>93</sup> (I or II cent. A.D.) speaks of the Buddha's
visit to the hermitage called ‘the city of the royal sage Gaya’,
who was later conceived as a great giant.<sup>94</sup>
<div n="P"/>We can find evidence of the importance of Gayā growing
in the period subsequent to A.D. 750. At Gayā while we have
only one inscription belonging to the Gupta period, we get
numerous inscriptions belonging to the Pāla period.<sup>95</sup> But
these records are of not much use for the history of the town,
they simply show that till the end of the twelfth century A.D.
it was under the Pālas.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city played no major role in polities at any period of
history but it was certainly a centre of religious movements of
Buddhist and the Brahmanical Hindus.<sup>97</sup> Gayā which was the
headquarters of Buddhist faith passed to the Hindus between
the second and fourth centuries of the Christian era and by
A.D. 637 when Hiuen Tsang visited the city it had become a
thriving centre of Hindu Brahmanical religion.<sup>98</sup>
<div n="P"/>The religious importance of Gayā is met with in the Māhā-
bhārata,<sup>99</sup> Rāmāyaṇa<sup>100</sup> and Purāṇas.<sup>101</sup> The Gayā has a
special religious importance with reference to the Śrāddha cere-
mony.<sup>102</sup>

2. {%Khād(ṭā)pāra<sup>103</sup>%}¦ (No. 29, L. 7):
The inscription came from a place Dhanaidaha in the Natore
subdivision of the Rajashahi district (in Puṇḍravardhana).<sup>104</sup>
[Page-216+ 39]
So this viṣaya may be assigned to the Puṇḍravardhana bhukti.
The name of the district cannot be read with certainty. Sen<sup>105</sup>
suggests three readings: Mahā-Khushāpāra, Khādā(ṭā) pāra, or
Khusaspāra. Banerji gives the reading ‘Mahā-khuṣāpāra.<sup>106</sup>

It has been described as a viṣaya under Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti.
This reference clearly shows that the size of a viṣaya was small-
er than that of a bhukti. The viṣaya of Koṭivarṣa occurs frequ-
ently in the epigraphic records of the Pālas and Senas.<sup>107</sup> It
seems to have comprised the southern part of the Dinajpur
district, the northern portion of Rajashahi and probably also
the eastern tracts of the Bogra district.<sup>108</sup> Its head-quarters was
Diw-kot (Devakoṭa or Devīkoṭa).<sup>109</sup> Yādavaprakāśa identifies
Koṭivarṣa with Devīkoṭṭa.<sup>110</sup> The Vāyu Purāṇa also refers to a
city of the name of Koṭivarṣa.<sup>111</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Prakrit lexicon Pāia-sadda-mahaṇṇavo describes it as
the capital of Lāṭa country.<sup>112</sup> The name is known to the Jain
Prajñāpanā in which it is placed in Lāḍha or Lāṭa.<sup>113</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hemacandra<sup>114</sup> says that Koṭivarṣa, Bāṇapura, Devīkoṭa,
Umāvana and Śoṇitapura are identical. Puruṣottama<sup>115</sup> agrees
with Hemacandra with the only difference that he mentions
Uṣāvana in place of Umāvana. Bāṇapura is represented by
Bāngarh in the Dinajpur district, which still preserves the exten-
sive ruins of a citadel known as Damdamaḥ said to have been
the fort of Devīkoṭa associated with the exploits of the mythi-
cal king Bāṇa.<sup>116</sup> Diw-koṭa or Devīkoṭa (wrongly read as Dihi-
kota in the A-In-i-Akbarī) was a mahal under the Sarkar of
Lakhnautī (Lakṣaṇavatī).<sup>117</sup>
<div n="P"/>The termination varṣa is significant. It denotes a division
of the earth as separated off by mountain ranges.<sup>118</sup> From the
Purāṇas we know of such names as Harivarṣa, Kiṃpuruṣa-
Varṣa and Bhārata-Varṣa.<sup>119</sup> Varṣam in Pāṇini<sup>120</sup> means the
rainy season. We know that rains are connected with the moun-
tains. So originally the divisions might have been made accord-
ing to the rains in different areas. Rains being very important
for agriculture affect the inhabitants of a certain area through-
out the year. Later on the semantic development of the word
came to denote a year. In India the seasons have been regard-
ed to be important and hence they had often been used to
[Page-217+ 40]
denote the year.<sup>121</sup>

4. {%Kṛmilā%}¦ (No. 40, L. 5):
The Viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā also spelt as Krimilā is mention-
ed in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the
charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centu-
ries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the
existence of a viṣaya and therefore of a city of the above name
in the fourth century.<sup>122</sup> But certain old seals found at Nālandā
prove the existence of Kṛmilā before the Pāla occupation of
Bihar.<sup>123</sup> The village Kavāla in the Krimilāviṣaya known from
one such seal can be identified with modern Kawāli not far
from Valgūdar.<sup>124</sup> The viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā is also men-
tioned in the records of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar.<sup>125</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to a tradition recorded in the Harivaṃśa,<sup>126</sup>
Vayu Purāṇa<sup>127</sup> and the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>128</sup> Kṛmi, the son
of king Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen
Kṛmi, was the lord of Kṛmilāpurī.<sup>129</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city
of Kṛmilā: Kimilā, Kimmilā and Kimbilā. The name of an
inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmilā or Kimbilā.
Malālasekera<sup>130</sup> recognises the spellings Kimilā or Kimbilā and
Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbilā and Kimbilā.
Kimilā can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kṛmilā (or Krimilā),
and Kimmilā can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant
Kirmilā.<sup>131</sup> Two Suttas, the Kimilāsutta and Kimilasutta, were
preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of
Kimilā (Kṛmilā) said to have been situated on the bank of the
Gaṅgā. The river is now at a short distance from the villages
of Valgūdar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city
stood.<sup>132</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.S. Pandey<sup>133</sup> opposes the identification of Kṛmilā with
Valgūdar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence
to prove this identification. Though Kṛmilā is not referred to
in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kṛmilā mention-
ed in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Commentary.<sup>134</sup> According to this
commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gaṅgā. But
now-a-days, the Gaṅgā flows at some distance from this region
which may be due to a change in the course of the river dur-
ing so many centuries. The city was not very important and
may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find
[Page-218+ 39]
any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the
Gaṅgā. According to Pandey<sup>135</sup> the name of the modern villa-
ge Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kṛmilā and it is
not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that
locality.
<div n="P"/>Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kṛmilā
with Valgūdar<sup>136</sup> and seems to prefer the claim of modern
Kawali not being far from Valgūdar Kṛmilā.<sup>137</sup> But in the
district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which
is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of
Dr. Pandey.
<div n="P"/>The word Kṛmilā means “a fruitful woman” or “a place
full of worms” and the word Kṛmi forming its first part is
sometimes also written as Krimi.<sup>138</sup>

5. {%Lāṭa<sup>139</sup>%}¦ (No. 17, L. 3)
The district or viṣaya of Lāṭa is here described as “pleasing
with choice trees that are bowed down by the weight of (their)
flowers, and with temples and assembly-halls of the gods, and
with vihāras, (and) the mountains of which are covered over
with vegetation”.
<div n="P"/>The country south of Mahī or at times south of the Nar-
badā up to the Pūrva or so far as Daman, was called Lāṭa and
‘it corresponded roughly with Southern Gujarat’.<sup>140</sup> It comp-
rised the collectorates of Surat, Bharoch, Kheda and parts of
Baroda territory.<sup>141</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Prof. Bühler, Lāṭa is Central Gujarat, the
district between the Mahī and Kim rivers and its chief city was
Broach.<sup>142</sup> Lāṭa has been identified with Central and Southern
Gujarat in the Rewah Stone Inscription of Karṇa.<sup>143</sup> We also
find the Lāṭa kingdom mentioned in other epigraphical reco-
rds.<sup>144</sup> Lāṭarāṣṭra<sup>145</sup> is identical with the old Lāṭa kingdom of
Gujarat, the capital city of which is stated in the Dīpavaṃśa to
have been Siṃapura (Sīhapura).<sup>146</sup> In the early days of the
imperial Guptas, the Lāṭa country was formed into an admini-
strative province in the Lāṭaviṣaya.<sup>147</sup> The Śaktisaṅgam Tantra
places the Lāṭa country to the west of Avanti and to the north-
west of Vidarbha.<sup>148</sup>
<div n="P"/>Lāṭa is the same as the Larike of Ptolemy which lay to the
east of Indo-Scythia along the sea-coast.<sup>149</sup> The word Lāṭa is
[Page-219+ 38]
derived from Sanskrit Rāṣṭra.<sup>150</sup> The Nāgara brāhmaṇas of
Lāṭa (Gujarat) are said to have invented the Nāgarī character
which is believed to have been derived from the Brāhmī alpha-
bet.<sup>151</sup>

In this inscription the viṣaya of Vaivya is mentioned. The word
Vaivya is inexplicable. We may, however, suggest that the term
was possibly derived from Prakrit Vevva<sup>153</sup> which means ‘fear’
and hence Vaivya would mean ‘fearful’ or ‘dreadful’.

 {%Maṇḍala%}¦
Maṇḍala is a territorial unit which is found in the inscriptions
of many dynasties of the early medieval period. Originally it
denoted in the Arthaśāstra and other legal texts,<sup>154</sup> a diploma-
tic circle of twelve neighbouring kings, some friendly and
others unfriendly, in relation to a king desirous of conquest.
The term could also be used for the territory under the posse-
ssion of a feudatory. But in the Gupta period maṇḍala is used
for some kind of administrative division though in early medie-
val period its use was in feudalistic association.<sup>155</sup> In Cālukyan
records, the governor of a maṇḍala was usually called a Maṇḍ-
aleśvara or Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara.<sup>156</sup> In the records of the Impe-
rial Guptas it denoted a unit smaller than a Vīthī.<sup>157</sup> Literally
meaning a circle or round it denotes a district, province, coun-
try in general or it may signify a surrounding district or neigh-
bouring state.<sup>158</sup>

Fleet translates it as ‘place’<sup>161</sup> but the term has a speci-

sion<sup>162</sup> or may correspond with the word viṣaya used in the
same context in the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Tora-
māṇa.<sup>163</sup> In modern usage pradeśa signifies a province.

 {%Airikiṇa%}¦ (No. 2, L. 25):
It has been described here as the bhoga-nagara of the king (sva-
bhoga-nagara).<sup>164</sup> In this context the use of the phrase ‘Sva-
bhoganagara’ is important. K.P. Jayaswal<sup>165</sup> interprets ‘sva bho-
ganagara’ as a town that had, since the victory scored by the
Gupta king at Eraṇ, become his direct personal possession.
Fleet translates it as ‘the city of his own enjoyment’.<sup>166</sup>
<div n="P"/>Daśaratha Sharma<sup>167</sup> explains it as analogous to the word
‘Ekabhoga’ defined in the Mānasāra as a town or village inha-
bited by a single land-holder along with his dependants.<sup>168</sup> It
is ‘Svabhoga’ for the master and ‘Ekabhoga’ for others’. Sharma
connects this ‘Svabhoga’ with a feudatory ‘who lived therein
with his family and dependants, and on whom Samudragupta,
pleased by his ‘devotion’, policy, and valour’ conferred the title
of Rājan and the accompanying glories of consecration, etc.
described in verse 4.<sup>169</sup> But Sharma seems to be incorrect in
associating the inscription with a feudatory, the inscription
belongs to Samudragupta himself which is clear by further
description in subsequent verses.<sup>170</sup> No doubt in the Eraṇ
Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa<sup>171</sup> the word ‘sva-viṣaya’
an adjectival clause of Airikiṇa is used to refer to a feudatory,
which is very clear from the inscription.
<div n="P"/>The editor<sup>172</sup> also, following Sharma, is misled and ex-
plains the term ‘Svabhoga’ as implying a grant, or something
like it by the governor of the province, who had for his own
salary the revenues of the city of Airikiṇa allotted to him.<sup>173</sup>
But the term ‘Svabhoganagara’ is significant in connoting royal
status, higher than that of a feudatory chief and can mean
‘the capital city’ where the king himself was residing. In con-
trast, in the Earṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa<sup>174</sup> the
[Page-221+ 38]
term ‘Sva-viṣaya’ has been used for the feudatory Dhanyaviṣṇu
(of king Toramāṇa) who may have been a viṣayapati, the ad-
ministrator-incharge of Eraṇ.
<div n="P"/>Airikiṇa is the same as modern Eraṇ, the ancient Airikiṇa,
a village on the left bank of the Bina, in Sagar District of
Madhya Pradesh. From the Copper Coins of the Aśokan
period found at Eraṇ, we get an earlier Pali or Prakrit form
of the name which is Erakaña or Erakana or Erakaṇa.<sup>175</sup> It
is thus clear that Erakaña or Erakaṇa is the simplified form of
Erikiṇa: to simplify still more the medial letter ‘k’ has been
dropped by the process of elision.<sup>176</sup> The meaning of the word
Erikiṇa is a puzzle but its connexion with erakā ‘a kind of
grass,<sup>177</sup> found in that area may be accepted as a hypothesis.

 {%Pur or Pura%}¦
Pur is a word of frequent occurrence in the Ṛgveda.<sup>209</sup> The
early Vedic Āryans were not city builders. Puras<sup>210</sup> which are
mentioned from the context seem to have been always associ-
ated with the dasyus and the enemies of the Āryans.<sup>211</sup> Pura,
the oldest Sanskrit word denoting city, is usually derived from
the Dravidian {%ur.%} From what we read in the Ṛgveda about
Puraṃdara's exploits in connection with the destruction of
the ninety-nine puras of the Asuras who had been causing
havoc to the gods, these puras seem to refer to the cities of
the Indus Valley pre-Āryans.<sup>212</sup> But the word {%ur%} is not availa-
ble in Dravidian lexicons: on the contrary it is pura which is
mentioned by them.<sup>213</sup> The word {%ur%} is not to be traced in the
I. E. languages.<sup>214</sup> We find {%Ur%} only as the name of a town in
Babylonia.<sup>215</sup> In Tamil country, in the inscriptions of the
Chola dynasty (A.D. 900-1300) the word {%‘ur’%} is used to
refer to ‘The Primary Assembly of the villagers’ in the case of
ordinary villages while in the same context the word Sabhā is
used in case of Agrahāra villages, mostly tenanted by learned
brāhmaṇas.<sup>216</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later Vedic literature<sup>217</sup> the word Pur meant ‘rampart’,
‘fort’, or ‘stronghold’. The meaning of Pura as ‘city’ developed
later and was not at all in vogue in the Vedic literature.
<div n="P"/>Lexicons define it as a place containing large buildings
surrounded by a ditch and extending not less than one Kośa in
length, if it extends for half that distance it is called a kheṭa;
if less than that, a karvaṭa or small market town, any smaller
cluster of houses is called a grāma or village.<sup>218</sup> The Sama-
[Page-225+ 39]
rāṅgaṇasūtradhāra describes puras as being of three kinds —
Big, middle and small which have different measurements for
their ditches, buildings, streets and road-ways.<sup>219</sup> The big one
possesses a circumference of four thousand arcs, the middle of
two thousand arcs and the small of one thousand arcs.<sup>220</sup>
T. Burrow derives pura from §pri to fill Piparti ‘fills’: pur ‘city’:
Lithuanian pilis (l becomes r).<sup>221</sup> We find the word being spelt
in two ways pur<sup>222</sup> and pura<sup>223</sup> Pur (city), from puru (much)
and pūrṇa (full) means ‘plentitude’ or multitude of settlers.
Similarly Greek polis (city) from poly (much): Latin populus
(population, people) from plenus (full), and English folk from
full. Pur is the city and puruṣa the citizen. Greek polites
(citizens), is preserved in politics (civic concerns), police (city
administration), and cosmopolitan (citizen of the world):
Lithuanian pilis (fort, castle).<sup>224</sup> In modern times the word
purā (from pura) is used for mohalla in India. It seems to be
the result of Muslim contact.<sup>225</sup>

dhyāyī, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and the Kāśikā.<sup>227</sup> The word
Mahāpura in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>228</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>229</sup>
denotes a great fortress. Probably the only difference between
the Pur and Mahāpura was in their size.<sup>230</sup>

(1) {%Ajapura%}¦ (No. 12, L. 25):
In Inscription No. 12, we find the mention of the town of Aja-
[Page-226+ 39]
pura. The name of the viṣaya of which it was a part has been
damaged. Since the column bearing the inscription was origi-
nally found in front of the northern gate of the odl fort of
Bihar,<sup>231</sup> we can easily identify Ajapura with the modern vill-
age of the same name in the Rājagṛha viṣaya which is not very
far from Nālandā.<sup>232</sup> The name of the viṣaya which included
this town can possibly be restored as Rājagṛha in the damaged
part of the inscription.

<LEND>

<L>368<pc>226<k1>दशपुर<k2>दशपुर
(3) {%Daśapura%}¦ (No. 17, L. 4, L. 16):
In this inscription L. 4 refers to the migration of a guild of silk-
weavers from Lāṭa viṣaya (Central and Southern Gujarat) to
the city of Daśapura. The guild came to this city attracted by
the virtues of its kings.<sup>234</sup> The inscription refers itself to the
reign of king Kumāragupta, under whom Bandhuvarman, the
son of Viśvavarman<sup>235</sup> was the governor at Daśapura. L. 16 of
the inscription records that it was under the governorship of
Bandhuvarman (in Mālava era 493 = A.D. 437)<sup>236</sup>, that a lofty
temple of the Sun-god was caused to be built by the guild of
silk-cloth weavers at Daśapura.<sup>237</sup> Afterwards, under other
kings, part of this temple fell into disrepair. And then it was
restored by the same guild in the year 529 of the Mālava era
(= A.D. 473).<sup>238</sup>
<div n="P"/>Daśapura has been identified with Mandasor in Western
Malwa<sup>239</sup> formerly in the Gwalior State. The ancient Daśapura
stood on the north or left bank of the Siwana, a tributary of
the river Śiprā.<sup>240</sup> We also find it mentioned in the Mandasor
Fragmentary Inscription of the time of Ādityavardhana (A.D.
490-500).<sup>241</sup> Under the Imperial Guptas the use of the Mālava
or the Kṛta era seems to have been confined to Daśapura.<sup>242</sup>
Thus Daśapura may have been the main city of the Western
Mālavas. We also get a reference to Daśapura in the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā<sup>243</sup> and the Meghadūta<sup>244</sup> of Kālidāsa.
<div n="P"/>The ancient Sanskrit name Daśapura also occurs in an early
Nasik inscription of Uṣavadāta,<sup>245</sup> and in one inscription of
Vikram Saṃvat 1321 (= A.D. 1264) from Mandasor itself.<sup>246</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are two explanations of the name Daśapura or Dasor.
The local explanation is that the place was originally a city of
[Page-227+ 39]
the Puranic king Daśaratha. But, on this view, the name of the
city should have been Daśarathapura or Dasrathore. Fleet
points out that even now, the township includes some twelve
to fifteen outlying hamlets or divisions (Khilcipur, Jankūpurā,
Rāmpuriyā, Candrapurā, Bālagañja, etc.) and that ‘when it was
originally constituted, it included exactly ten (daśa) such ham-
lets (pura)’.<sup>247</sup> This view of Fleet is more appealing.
<div n="P"/>Mandasor, the full form of the name of the town by which
it is officially known and which is entered in maps, is also
explained in two ways:
<div n="P"/>As suggested by Bhagwan Lal Indraji, it may represent
Manda-Daśapura, “the distressed or afflicted Daśapura,” referr-
ing to the overthrow of the town, and the destruction of the
Hindu temples in it, by the Musalmans, in memory of which,
even to the present day, the Nāgar brāhmaṇas of the area do
not drink water there. This is supported by the fact that some
paṇḍits still call it Mannadasor.<sup>248</sup>
<div n="P"/>F.S. Growse suggests that the name combines the two
names of Mad and Daśapura: the former<sup>249</sup> being the name of
a village (also called Afzalpur) about eleven miles south-east of
Mandasor, from which, it is said, were brought, from ruined
Hindu temples, the stones that were used in the construction
of the Musalman fort at Mandasor.<sup>250</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is very difficult to choose between the two explanations,
but the second seems to be more reasonable.

<L>369<pc>227<k1>इन्द्रपुर<k2>इन्द्रपुर
(4) {%Indrapura%}¦ (No. 16, L. 5, L. 6, L. 7, L. 8):
The inscription states that an endowment was given by a brāh-
maṇa named Devaviṣṇu for the maintenance of a lamp in a
temple of the Sun established by the merchants of the town of
Indrapura kṣatriyas named Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṃha
at Indrapura.
<div n="P"/>In line 5 we get ‘Candrāpuraka-Padmā’ as the reading
taken by Fleet<sup>251</sup> and he thus considers it a separate town than
Indrapura.<sup>252</sup> But the correct reading should be as ‘Cendra-
puraka-Padmā’, since we find a small stroke by the left side of
‘c’. The stroke in other lines for ‘e’ is very clear (e. g. in L. 2)
though it is not very clear in L. 5 still we cannot read it simply
‘c’. The reading ‘ce’ for ‘c’ has been suggested by Sircar and
Jagannath.<sup>253</sup> Thus we see that the Padmā referred in line 5
[Page-228+ 39]
of this inscription also belongs to Indrapura.
<div n="P"/>Now we find two different spellings of Indrāpura in lines 5
and 6 and Indrapura in lines 7 and 8.<sup>254</sup>
<div n="P"/>What we can find out here is that the affix ‘ka’ in lines 5
and 6 is very important which seems to have grammatically a
succinct purpose here. The vṛddhi of the first vowel ‘i’ was
desirable here as is also clear by the use of affix ‘ka’ in the
Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.<sup>255</sup> So it is a weaker
form of the affix ‘ka’, without vṛddhi of the vowel in the first
syllable.<sup>256</sup> The writer seems to have used the long vowel
(with the last syllable of Indra) instead of vṛddhi in the first
syllable to avoid confusion between Aindrapura and Indrapura.
We do not find any such example of the elongation of vowel
in the classical Sanskrit literature though we find its rare use
in Vedic literature.<sup>257</sup> So we shall translate ‘Indrāpuraka Pad-
mā’ as ‘Padmā of (the town of) Indrapura and ‘Indrapuraka-
vaṇigbhyām’ as ‘merchants of (the town of) Indrapura’. This
Indrapura is the same as modern Indor,<sup>258</sup> near Dibhāi, Buland-
shahr district, U.P.<sup>259</sup> The ancient town of Indrapura was
situated on a large and lofty mound about five miles to the
north-west of Dibhāi.<sup>260</sup> Now-a-days it is only a kheḍā or deser-
ted mound, and is not shown in maps<sup>261</sup>

<L>370<pc>228<k1>कर्तृपुर<k2>कर्तृपुर
(5) {%Kartṛpura%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
<div n="P"/>Though the most accepted and correct reading is Kartṛpura,
some scholars prefer to read Katṛipura<sup>262</sup> or Kātripura.<sup>263</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is one of the five frontier kingdoms<sup>264</sup> mentioned in the
inscription whose kings did homage and paid tribute to Samu-
dragupta. Scholars differ in their views about the identification
of this place-name:
<div n="P"/>According to smith,<sup>265</sup> this kingdom ‘occupied the lower
ranges of the western Himalayas, including probably Kumaon,
Garhwal, and Kangra’. Oldham<sup>266</sup> holds that the kingdom of
Kātripura, included Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal and Kangra.
Fleet<sup>267</sup> suggests that the name may survive in Kartarpur in
the Jullundur district.
<div n="P"/>We prefer the view of Daśaratha Sharma.<sup>268</sup> His conten-
tion is that amongst the five frontier kingdoms mentioned in
the inscription, the first three belong to the East, the fourth
one belongs to the North, hence it will be better to leave aside
[Page-229+ 39]
the northern and eastern sides of the empire and to look for
Kartṛpura somewhere to the west of the Gupta dominions.
Consequently he finds Karor or Karūr to be a good equivalent
for Kartṛpura.<sup>269</sup> Kara here stands for Kartṛ and ‘ur’ or ‘ūr’
would stand here for pura.<sup>270</sup> Karūr, again, is to be preferred
to the other alternatives on account of its associations with the
Gupta period of Indian History. According to Al-Beruni, an
eastern king, called Vikramāditya, put to flight and killed a
Śaka ruler in the region of Karūr, between Multan and Loni.<sup>271</sup>
This Vikramāditya is to be identified with Candragupta II
‘the enemy of the Śakas’, who disguised as his brother's wife,
Dhruvasvāminī, ‘ripped upon the belly of the Śaka ruler’,
and destroyed the Śaka army, most probably, in Kartṛpura or
Karūr.<sup>272</sup>
<div n="P"/>This was the first encounter between the Śakas and Vikramā-
ditya, and Karūr, Karor, or Kartṛpura was the theatre of the
war because of its intermediate position between the Śaka
dominions and the Gupta empire.<sup>273</sup>

Krīpura was the place from which Vainyagupta issued his land-
grant in A.D. 507-08, was evidently the seat of his govern-
ment.<sup>274</sup> It was the victorious camp full of great ships and
elephants and horses (situated).<sup>275</sup> The place is of unknown
identity,<sup>276</sup> but is possibly to be looked for in Bengal.<sup>277</sup>

<L>372<pc>229<k1>कुस्थलपुर<k2>कुस्थलपुर
(7) {%Kusthalapura%}¦ (No. I, L. 20):
Kusthalapura ruled by Dhanañjaya is mentioned as one of
the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms subdued by Samudragupta. Smith
takes it to be a mistake for Kuśasthalapura,<sup>278</sup> and identifies
it with the holy city of Dwarka, the capital of Ānartta, i. e.
North Gujarat.<sup>279</sup> Raj Bali Pandey also identifies it with
Kuśasthalī (Dwarka)<sup>280</sup> G. Ramdas locates the place in
Gujarat following Smith.<sup>281</sup> Monier Williams also identifies
Kuśasthala with the town of Dwarka.<sup>282</sup> Bhandarkar, follow-
ing Barnett identifies the place with Kuttalur near Polur in
North Arcot.<sup>283</sup>
<div n="P"/>This Kuśasthalī is not situated in Gujarat but presumably on
the eastern spurs of the Vindhya range near Daksiṇakosala.<sup>284</sup>
It was the capital of Kuśa, son of Rāmacandra.<sup>285</sup> But its
[Page-230+ 39]
position in the list of the States of Dakṣiṇāpatha indicates a
place a little more to the south.
<div n="P"/>By the process of Haplology,<sup>286</sup> Kuśasthalapura is simpli-
fied into Kusthalapura which may be changed to Kuśasthalī
or Kuśāvatī in short.
<div n="P"/>The suffix sthala or sthalī is significant: it suggests a high-
lying country, an eminence, tableland, or dry-land as opposed
to a damp low-land.<sup>287</sup> The Mahābhārata, Harivaṃśa, early
Jain and Pali literature use the word in this sense.<sup>288</sup> The
Mahābhārata mentions both Kuśasthala as well as kuśa-sthalī.
The latter is supposed to be another name of Dwarka.<sup>289</sup>

<L>373<pc>230<k1>पाटलिपुत्र<k2>पाटलिपुत्र
(8) {%Pāṭaliputra%}¦ (No. 7, L. 12; No. 6, L. 4; No. 1, L. 14):
It is the same as modern Patna situated to the south of the
river Gaṅgā. Inscription No. 7 refers to Pāṭaliputra. Inscrip-
tion No. 6 mentions Vīrasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister
for peace and war under Candragupta II, who knew the mean-
ings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind,
who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pāṭali-
putra.<sup>290</sup> Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Puṣpa
where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.<sup>291</sup>
Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the
word Pāṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra) used by Aśoka, in his rock
edicts.<sup>292</sup> The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the
abundance of flowers.<sup>293</sup> Its name Puṣpapura is also met with
in the Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>294</sup> It is mentioned in the Mudrārākṣasa
as well.<sup>295</sup> The Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva<sup>296</sup> (11th century)
describes it as a place of both wealth and education though
generally there is a fight between Śrī (lakṣmī) and Sarasvatī.<sup>297</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a
tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahma-
sabhās, organised by kings, which examined poets like Kālidāsa,
Bhartṛmaṇṭha, Amara, Rūpa, Āryaśūra, Bhāravi and Candra-
gupta in Viśālā (Ujjainī) and where such great masters of gram-
mar as Upavarṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararūci and
Patañjali were examined in Pāṭaliputra and attained fame.<sup>298</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa<sup>299</sup> (A.D. 800) mentions Pāṭali-
putra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his
learned Council of brāhmaṇa philosophers and to his intimacy
with Pāṇini. “After him (Sūrasena) there will be king Nanda
[Page-231+ 39]
at Puṣpa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there
will be brāhmaṇa controversialists and the king will be surroun-
ded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was
a Buddhist brāhmaṇa, Vararūci, who was of high soul, kind
and good. His great friend was a brāhmaṇa, Pāṇini by
name”.<sup>300</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kāśikā<sup>301</sup> records two divisions of Pāṭaliputra:
<div n="P"/>1. Pūrva-Pāṭaliputra (eastern on the Gaṅgā)
<div n="P"/>2. Apara-Pāṭaliputra (western on the Śoṇa)
<div n="P"/>Patañjali<sup>302</sup> mentions the western Pāṭaliputra. A citizen
of Pāṭaliputra was called Pāṭaliputraka.<sup>303</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Am-
bassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta
Maurya.<sup>304</sup> The Pāla inscriptions refer to it by the name
Śrīnagara.<sup>305</sup>
<div n="P"/>The termination ‘Putra’ in Pāṭaliputra is difficult to
explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote
the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the
mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala
putra) in Aśokan Rock-edicts.<sup>306</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name Pāṭaliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of
Pāṭali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Puṣpapura and
Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘Śrīnag-
ara’ means ‘a beautiful city.<sup>307</sup> Because of the abundance of
flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by
other names also, viz., Puṣpapura, Puspapurī and Kusumapura.<sup>308</sup>
According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura
(K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kus-
uma) in the royal enclosure.<sup>309</sup> Later its glory was replaced by
that of Kānyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.<sup>310</sup>
<div n="P"/>The meaning of ‘Pāṭaliputra’ is explained in the legendary
origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a
brāhmaṇa of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked
to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went
out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad.
When asked, he told that his life was waning without any
company. In a joke his friends made the Pāṭali tree, under
which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words
he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pāṭali flower
[Page-232+ 39]
(Bignonia Suaveloens).<sup>311</sup> As the Sun was about to set, all
the students proposed to return home but the young student
fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next
day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple.
After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay
there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the
old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him
and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusuma-
pura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie
built the mansion for the youth the country was named as
Pāṭaliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pāṭali tree).”<sup>312</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was
Pāṭaliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped.
<div n="P"/>The Buddhist literature informs us that Pāṭaliputra was
originally a village known as Pāṭaligāma. Ajātaśatru is said
to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licc-
havis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his
way from Rājagṛha to Vaiśālī, passed through this village
on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village
was destined to become a great city.<sup>313</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vāyu-Purāṇa attributes the real foundation of Pāṭali-
putra to Rājā Ajāta-Śatru's grandson, Udaya or Udayāśva.
It was he who first removed the capital from Rājagṛha to
Pāṭaliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)<sup>314</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṭaliputra had closely been associated with multifarious
political and cultural activities right from the fifth century
B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.<sup>315</sup> It had the
honour to be the capital of the Śaiśunāgas, the Nandas, the
Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas until the Hūṇa inva-
sion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Harṣavardhana
(7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.<sup>316</sup> Śaśāṅka
Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monas-
teries at Pāṭaliputra.<sup>317</sup> Dharmapāla, the most powerful of
the Pāla kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.<sup>318</sup>
<div n="P"/>Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted
for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about
A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort
there. It then came into importance under its modern name
Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now
[Page-233+ 36]
the capital of Bihar.<sup>319</sup>

<L>374<pc>233<k1>पिष्टपुर<k2>पिष्टपुर
(9) {%Piṣṭapura%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
It has been mentioned as one of the southern regions which
were first captured and then liberated by Samudragupta.<sup>320</sup>
Mahendragiri is mentioned as its king. Piṣṭapura is the same
as the fortress Piṣṭapura captured by the Cālukya king
Pulakeśin II. The Tāṇḍivāda grant of Pṛthivī Mahārāja also
refers to Piṣṭapura.<sup>321</sup> Piṣṭapura is modern Pithapuram in the
Godavari district of the Madras Presidency.<sup>322</sup> It was the
capital of Kaliṅga.<sup>323</sup> ‘Kaliṅgādhipati’ Anantavarman issued
a grant<sup>324</sup> from the victorious city of Piṣṭapura. This grant
records that Anantavarman's grandfather Guṇavarman ruled
over Devarāṣṭra with Piṣṭapura as its chief city.<sup>325</sup> In our
inscription Devarāṣṭra<sup>326</sup> has been treated separately. It seems
that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devarāṣṭra
and Kaliṅga) were separate states but later on under Guṇavar-
man they were amalgamated.
<div n="P"/>Guha ruled over the whole of Kaliṅga and the neighbour-
ing regions.<sup>327</sup> Guha belonged to the Sālaṅkāyana family of
brāhmaṇas. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in
Kaliṅga.<sup>328</sup> Guha was already reigning over Kaliṅga (with his
capital at Piṣṭapura) when Samudragupta conquered him and
placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been
another name given to him on account of the extension of
his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.<sup>329</sup> It is interesting
to note that Kālidāsa<sup>330</sup> refers to Raghu defeating a king
named Mahendranātha in the course of his southern campaign.
It is tempting to connect Mahendranātha with Mahendragiri.
After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in
the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.<sup>331</sup>
<div n="P"/>At Piṣṭapura there is a Vaiṣṇava temple named Kunti-
mādhava.<sup>332</sup> We get references to Piṣṭapurī or Piṣṭapurikādevī,
a form at Mānapura, of the goddess Lakṣmī, in the inscriptions
of the Privrājaka Mahārājas and the Mahārājas of Uccakalpa
during the Gupta period.<sup>333</sup> This must be a local form of some
popular goddess at Piṣṭapura itself.<sup>334</sup>

<L>375<pc>234<k1>नगर<k2>नगर
 {%Nagara:%}¦
Nagara means a town, a city.<sup>335</sup> we find the term being
used by Pāṇini (IV. 2. 142).<sup>336</sup> The word Nāgaraka (or
Nāgarika)<sup>337</sup> also occurs in Sanskrit literature as standing for
‘an inhabitant of a town’ but sometimes its use was restricted
for the chief of a town or a police-officer. In modern times
nāgarika is used to refer to ‘a citizen of a state whether living
in city or village’.
<div n="P"/>In the early Vedic literature Nagara is found only as the
derivative adjective Nagarin, used as a proper name, but it
appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (1. 11,
18: 31, 4) and frequently in the later works.<sup>338</sup>
<div n="P"/>Nagara is an important factor which helps us to distinguish
Janapada from rāṣṭra: nagara forms a part of the rāṣṭra but
is excluded from the Janapada.<sup>339</sup> Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra
uses Nagara and Pura as synonyms.<sup>340</sup> It is significant that
the word Nagara is of late occurrence.<sup>341</sup> It is likely
that in the early Vedic times city life does not seem to have
developed much. In the Epic,<sup>342</sup> there are references to
Nagara, ‘a city’: Grāma ‘Village’: and Ghoṣa ‘ranch’. Vedic
literature especially of the earlier period is generally confined
to the village. The siege of puras is mentioned in the Saṃhitās
and Brāhmaṇas.
<div n="P"/>The word Nagara is changed into:<sup>343</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Nar as Kuśīnagara, Kusinar, Girinagara, Girnar
<div n="P"/>(b) Ner as Jīrṇanagara, Jooner.

In No. 21 the word ‘Ayodhyā-Vāsaka’ occurs<sup>355</sup> while in No. 37
and 39 the word ‘Āyodhyaka’ has been mentioned. In No, 21,
Ayodhyā is described as a victorious camp. full of great ships,
and elephants and horses. In No. 39 certain brāhmaṇas belong-
ing to Ayodhyā, living in the vicinity of Mahādeva Śaileśvara
are named and are mentioned as belonging to various gotras
and caraṇas, and as proficient in observants, in sacred duty,
in the mantras, the sūtras, bhāṣyas and pravacanas.<sup>356</sup>
<div n="P"/>It has been venerated as one of the most important and
holy places of the Hindus.<sup>357</sup> Vinītā was another name for
this city.<sup>358</sup> Its other names including Viṇīā (Vinītā) are men-
tioned in the Vividhatīrthakalpa.<sup>359</sup> Fa-Hsien calls it Sha-che
and Ptolemy knew it as Sogeda.<sup>360</sup> Ayodhyā and Sāketa have
been treated by many writers as being identical. Csoma de
kōrös<sup>361</sup> calls this place as “Sāketan or Ayodhyā” and H.H.
Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sāketa as ‘the city of
Ayodhyā’. Several passages in the Raghuvaṃśa<sup>362</sup> confirm it.
The Vividhatīrthakalpa mentions Sākeyam (Sāketa) as a
synonym for Ayodhyā,<sup>363</sup> but in the Buddhist literature we find
separate references to Ayodhyā and Sāketa which creates
doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed
separately.<sup>364</sup> V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring
in the Yuga Purāṇa, a section of Gārgī Saṃhitā,<sup>365</sup> to show
that Sāketa is the same as Ayodhyā. But there is nothing in
the passage to support the view.
<div n="P"/>The ancient city of Ayodhyā or Sāketa is described in the
Rāmāyaṇa as situated on the banks of the Sarayū or Sarjū
river.<sup>366</sup> During the Buddhist period, Ayodhyā was divided into
[Page-237+ 39]
Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Dakṣiṇa (Southern) Kosala.
The river Sarayū was the dividing line between the two pro-
vinces. Ayodhyā was the capital of the latter.<sup>367</sup> Ancient
tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.<sup>368</sup>
<div n="P"/>The history of Kośala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and
his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence
of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas,
followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kośala in their empire.
Under the Śuṅgas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscrip-
tion from Ayodhyā mentions Puṣyamitra as having performed
two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kuṣāṇas, the city remained
more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Purāṇas it figures
along with Prayāga and Magadha as forming part of
the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gayā Plate of
Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta
camp of victory. The history of the city in the post-
Gupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the
empire of the Pratihāras and Gāhaḍavālas of Kanauj. Ayodhyā
is described by Muslim historians<sup>369</sup> to have been a wilder-
ness.
<div n="P"/>The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subse-
quently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh.
It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from
Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom
Ayodhyā was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town
in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later
Chronicles.<sup>370</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ayodhyā is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are
several places in the city connected with different events in the
life of Rāma. Rāma was born at a place called Janmasthāna. At
Chīrodaka also called Chīrasāgara, Daśaratha performed, with
the help of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Ṛṣi, the sacrifices for obtaining a son.
At a place called Tretā-kā-Ṭhākur, Rāmacandra performed the
horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Sītā. At Ratnamaṇ-
ḍapa, he held his Council,<sup>371</sup> at Swargadwāram in Fyzabad,
his body was burnt. At Lakṣmaṇa-kuṇḍa, Lakṣmaṇa disappeared
in the river Sarayū. Daśaratha accidentally killed Śravaṇa,
the blind Ṛṣi's son, at Majhaurā in the district of Fyzabad.<sup>372</sup>
Ayodhyā engaged the attention of the Muslim rulers some of
[Page-238+ 38]
whom set up mosques here, of these the mosques of Babar and
and Aurangzeb are notable.<sup>373</sup> At present this city forms a
part of the district of Fyzabad.

Āmrakārddava, the son of Undāna, and apparently an officer
of Candragupta II to the Āryasaṃgha at the great vihāra of
Kākanādaboṭa for the purpose of feeding mendicants.<sup>375</sup> The
word Īśvara here is connected with Vāsaka and there is no infix
or place-name suffix in between (just as ‘pura’ in Ānandapura-
vāsaka). Hence vāsaka here has a double purpose. It is mean-
ingful to Īśvara and also denotes the inhabitation. The whole
will literally mean ‘an inhabitation of God’.

It is one of the southern countries subdued by Samudragupta.
Its ruler was Vyāghararāja. Literally Mahākāntāra means ‘a
great forest’. It has to be distinguished from Sarvāṭavi referred
to later on in this inscription.<sup>378</sup> According to Krishnaswami
Aiyangar,<sup>379</sup> it must have included the Saugar division of C.P.
extending northwards to the Ajaigadh State in Bundelkhanda.
But G. Ramdas differs from this view on the ground that Mahā-
kāntāra must be sought in Southern India as it is specifically
mentioned as one of the kingdoms of the South conquered
by Samudragupta. He suggests that Mahākāntāra must be the
same as Mahāvana, a forest region extending northwards into
[Page-239+ 37]
Ganjam Agency and westwards into the tract formerly
known as the Chatisgarh States of C.P.<sup>380</sup> This very region has
been mentioned by the same name in the Ganj and Nachna

<L>390<pc>239<k1>ग्राम<k2>ग्राम
 {%Grāma:%}¦
<div n="P"/>It means an inhabited place, village, hamlet.<sup>383</sup> It seems
that firstly the word grāma denoted the collective inhabi-
tants of a place, community or race. Later on this sense was
transferred to an inhabitation and was used in the sense of a
village. The earlier usage of this word, which occurs frequently
from the Ṛgveda<sup>384</sup> onwards, appears to have been in the sense
of a village. The early Āryans must have dwelt in villages which
were scattered over the country, some close together, some far
apart, and were connected by roads.<sup>385</sup> In the early Vedic
literature village is regularly contrasted with the forest (āraṇya)
in the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the
forest.<sup>386</sup> The villages were probably open, though perhaps a
fort(pur) might on occasion be built inside.<sup>387</sup> Presumably they
consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details
are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahā-
grāmāḥ) were known.<sup>388</sup> The grāma may, however, perhaps
be regarded more correctly as an aggregate of several fami-
lies, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
(viś), as is often the case at the present day.<sup>389</sup> The head of the
village was called Grāmaṇi or ‘the leader of the village’. The
king's share in a village is referred to as early as the
Atharvaveda.<sup>390</sup>
<div n="P"/>Villages played an important role as a unit of Rāṣṭra or
city.<sup>391</sup> Kheṭa was the half of a city and the village was the
[Page-240+ 39]
half of a kheṭa.<sup>392</sup> Cities other than the capital are called
Karvaṭa, a little less is Nigama and lesser is grāma and still
lesser is a house.<sup>393</sup>
<div n="P"/>Grāma is changed into gaon,<sup>394</sup> as Suvarṇagrāma, Sonār-
gaon; Kalahagrāma, Kahalgaon.

Samada is possibly Samudra, an epithet for Siva. D.C. Sircar
takes ‘Samudra’ to be the ‘nām-aika-deśa of a deity called

In No. 34 we get a reference to ‘Doṅgā’, but in No. 36, the
name appears as Doṅgā-grāma.
[Page-241+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The Doṅgā-grāma is said to have been situated in Himavac-
Chikhara<sup>403</sup> identified with Barāhachatra (Varāhakṣetra) in
Nepal.<sup>404</sup> But scholars<sup>405</sup> are not right in co-relating Doṅgā-
grāma with Himavac-Chikhara, Inscription No. 36 clarifies it.
There is a long gap between the references to Himavac-
Chikhara and Doṅgā-grāma. Actually Himavac-Chikhara is
associated with Kokāmukhasvāmin (a form of the Boar incar-
nation of Viṣṇu) and Śvetavarāhasvāmin where originally (ādya)
these gods were installed in a temple. The name Doṅgā-grāma
is used for the place where the lands were donated by Ṛbhupāla
for the construction of the two temples having the names of the
two deities.<sup>406</sup> The word ‘ādya’ in L. 7 is significant and dis-
tinguishes the temples at Himavac-Chikhara from those at
Doṅgā-grāma. The writer had to use the word ‘Himavac-
Chikhara’ again in L. 10, with the names of Kokāmukhasvāmin
and Śvetavarāhasvāmin in order to avoid confusion between
the temples at the two places. For the temple at Doṅgā-grāma
the writer uses the word ‘iha’ in L. 11. We also find the word
‘Himavac-Chikhara’ absent in another Dāmodarpur Copper
Plate Inscription of the Gupta Year 224 (= A.D. 543), where
a person named Amṛtadeva hailing from Ayodhyā donates a
land for the repairs and worship, etc., at the temple of Lord
Śvetavarāhasvāmin obviously because he was referring to the
temple at Doṅgā-grāma and there was now, no question of any
confusion or distinction.<sup>407</sup> Thus Doṅgāgrāma does not seem
to have any connection with Himavac-Chikhara. This village
is to be located somewhere near Dāmodarpur and belonged to
the Koṭivarṣa viṣaya as mentioned in the records.<sup>408</sup> But the
village was most probably situated in a hilly area which is clear
from the word Doṅgā itself.<sup>409</sup> The word ‘Atrāraṇye’ (local
forest where the temple of Śvetavarāhasvāmin was situated) in
No. 37 also attests to it.<sup>410</sup> The village may have consisted of a
few huts with bushes and trees all around or the place where
the temples were situated was away from habitation.
<div n="P"/>Thus the earlier suggestion that the Koṭivarṣa district
included the hilly region bordering on the northern fringe of
Bengal,<sup>411</sup> which was rejected by Sircar,<sup>412</sup> seems to be
correct.

<div n="P"/>Goṣāṭa may be the same as gośālā or a cow-stall<sup>413</sup> and

(esp.) a settlement of wild tribes (e. g. Triśira-pallī = Trichin-
opoly).<sup>443</sup> Pallī has been used as meaning a den of thieves in
the Uttarādhyanasūtra and other Jain canonical texts,<sup>444</sup> the
earliest portions of which are assigned to about 300 B.C.<sup>445</sup>
[Page-245+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra by king Bhojadeva, an ele-
venth century work, defines Pallī thus:
<div n="P"/>“Where Pulindas<sup>446</sup> live building their huts with leafs,
branches and stones etc. is called Pallī and a small Pallī is
called Pallīkā”.<sup>447</sup>
<div n="P"/>Its derivation from §pal to go, to move, fits in very well as
it was an inhabitation of Ābhīras, thieves and barbarians who
moved from one place to another and were usually in small
number.
<div n="P"/>It seems to be a Dravidian word loaned in Sanskrit. We
find in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada the word palli meaning
hamlet, settlement, small village and in Telugu the words Palli
and Palliya denoting ‘a small village’.<sup>448</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pallī<sup>449</sup> is changed into:
<div n="P"/>(a) bal: Āśāpallī, Yessabal
<div n="P"/>(b) Poli, as Triśirapallī (= Trishṇāpallī), Trichinopoly
<div n="P"/>(c) oli, as Ahalyapallī, Ahiroli (also Ahiāri).
<div n="P"/>We have only one place-name ending in this suffix, with
a slight variation which is ‘palla’ and is detailed below:

 {%Eraṇḍapalla%}¦ (No. I, L. 19):
It is mentioned in the list of countries of Southern region
conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Damana. Fleet
identifies Eraṇḍapalla with Erandol in the E. Khandesh
district of the Bombay Presidency.<sup>450</sup> K.N. Dikshit and Y.R.
Gupte agreed with this view.<sup>451</sup> But according to Dubreuil and
K.G. Sankar, it is the same as the town Erandpalli near
Chicacole on the Coast of Orissa.<sup>452</sup> G. Ramdas opposes
Fleet's identification on the ground that Eraṇḍapallī mentioned
immediately after the kingdom of Svāmidatta cannot be so far
away on the western coast, it must have been in the vicinity
of Kaliṅga and Piṣṭapura kingdom.<sup>453</sup> Eraṇḍapallī is mentioned
in the Siddhantam plates of Devendravarman of Kaliṅga.<sup>454</sup>
Banerjee counts Damana of Eraṇḍapalla among the three
chiefs of Kaliṅga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta
through their country.<sup>455</sup>
<div n="P"/>G. Ramdas<sup>456</sup> regards Dubreuil's identification also to
be incorrect because Chicacole lies in Kaliṅga which was clearly
the country ruled by Svāmidatta. Eraṇḍapallī will have, there-
fore, to be identified with the village Yendipalli in the Golgonda
[Page-246+ 37]
Taluka of the Vizagapatam district or with the village Eṇḍapalli
in Elore Tāluka.<sup>457</sup> But if we suppose that Svāmidatta was
the king of Koṭṭūra alone and not of the whole of Kaliṅga,
Eraṇḍapallī may well be identified with Chicacole.<sup>458</sup>
<div n="P"/>Palla is the corrupt form of Pallī which means an inhabitation
and Eraṇḍa is the castor-oil-plant<sup>459</sup> It seems that the region
abounded in eraṇḍa plants.

long ‘ī’ i. e. as gohālī,<sup>461</sup> but in No. 43 it has been spelt with
short ‘i’.<sup>462</sup> This suffix has been used with the names of villages.
These villages were known as gohālikas,<sup>463</sup> in a similar context

<L>424<pc>248<k1>क्षेत्र<k2>क्षेत्र
 {%Kṣetra%}¦
<div n="P"/>Originally meaning an agricultural field, in which sense its
use survives, kṣetra came to be used as a place-name suffix
as we find in the word Kurukṣetra. As a suffix in com-
position it signified simply a ‘field’ for the word preceding it.
For example karma-kṣetra, dharma-kṣetra, raṇa-kṣetra, siddha-
kṣetra, sureśvarī-kṣetra.<sup>480</sup>
<div n="P"/>The use of this word<sup>481</sup> in the Ṛgveda points clearly to the
existence of separate fields<sup>482</sup> carefully measured off,<sup>483</sup> though
in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating culti-
vated land generally.<sup>484</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>485</sup> and later, the
sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more
general use is also found.<sup>486</sup> The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,<sup>487</sup> ‘Lord
of the Field’ should probably be understood as the god presid-
ing over each field, just as Vāstoṣpati presides over each
dwelling.<sup>488</sup>
[Page-249+ 38]
<div n="P"/>Kṣetra is changed into:<sup>489</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Chatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahichatra
<div n="P"/>(b) Cchatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahicchatra.
<div n="P"/>In Prakrit Kṣetra changes to Kheṭṭa meaning ‘a land for
agriculture’, country, village and city, etc.<sup>490</sup>
<div n="P"/>Analogous to Kheṭṭa is the word ‘kheḍa’ or ‘kheṭa’ which
means ‘a city surrounded by rivers and mountains’.<sup>491</sup> ‘Kheṭa’
meaning ‘a small hamlet’ is also found in Pāṇini (VI. 2. 126).<sup>492</sup>
The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra defines ‘Kheṭa’ as the half of a
city and the grāma as the half of a ‘Kheṭa’.<sup>493</sup> According to
Monier Williams Kheṭa means a village, residence of peasants
and farmers, small town (half of a Pura).<sup>494</sup>
<div n="P"/>Lele<sup>495</sup> considers Kheṭa or Kheṭaka to be the dialectic form
of the word ‘Kṣetra’. The original meaning of Kheṭaka or Kheṭa
was an enclosure for cattle. In the course of time the pastoral
camp grew into an agricultural village, and the word Kheṭaka
came to include agricultural village.<sup>496</sup>
<div n="P"/>Here we collect the names of fields appearing in the inscri-
ptions of our study. These names can be attributed to the
names of individuals or gods. As the proper names are a part
of the names of the fields, we treat them as place-names and do
not discuss them in the context of personal-names. Some of
the names sound curious and at places the readings are doubt-
ful, the fascimile of the grant supplied by the editor being
blurred. It is interesting to note that all these names occur
in the same inscription, i. e. Gunaighar Grant of Vainya-
gupta, year 188 (No. 52). Gunaighar formerly Guṇikāgra-
hāra,<sup>497</sup> is a village about 18 miles to the north-west of the
town of Comilla, a mile and a half to the south west of the P.S.
Debidvar in the district of Tippera which is modern Tripur.<sup>498</sup>
The area is predominated by Tibeto-Burman tribes. Hence
some of the names are full of tribal vocabulary.<sup>499</sup>

7. {%Miduvilāla-kṣetra%}¦ (No. 52, L. 19):
The field belonged to Miduvilāla. The word Midu is a Prakritic
form of Sanskrit Mṛdu<sup>504</sup> which means soft, delicate or beauti-
ful. Pāia-Sadda-Mahaṇṇavo<sup>505</sup> takes Vilāla, Birāla, Biḍāla,
Bilāḍa and Bilāla as synonymous words meaning ‘a cat’. Ac-
cording to Bhattacharya ‘the word vilāla is evidently derived
from vila with its peculiar meaning (a large watery hollow)
current in Bengal.<sup>506</sup> D.C. Sircar takes it to be a mechanic
caste like vardhaki (carpenter).<sup>507</sup> We find the word Vilāla
occurring thrice in the Gunaighar grant (No. 52) which has
been translated by the editor of the grant as follows:
<div n="P"/>(a) Miduvilāla-kṣetra (L. 19): The field of Miduvilāla
<div n="P"/>(b) Pakkavilāla-kṣetra (LL. 21-22): The field of Pakkavilāla
<div n="P"/>(c) Gaṇeśvara-Vilāla-Puṣkariṇī (L. 28): the large marshy
pond of Gaṇeśvara.
<div n="P"/>All the three names have been explained according to their
context in this work.
<div n="P"/>In (a) and (b) the editor takes vilāla as a part of the names
Midu and Pakka but in (c) he translates vilāla as ‘a large
[Page-251+ 39]
marshy (place)’. The editor should have taken either Miduvi-
lāla and Pakkavilāla as the adjectives of the fields as in (c) or
Vilāla as an adjective of Gaṇeśvara and not that of Puṣkariṇī.
Vilāla seems to be a part of the names Midu and Pakka which
if left alone yield no meaning, but in the case of Gaṇeśvara
vilāla, the word vilāla seems to be an adjective of the name
Gaṇeśvara rather than a part of it. Here the word vilāla seems
to indicate a professional caste. It is a Dravidian word.<sup>508</sup> The
whole sense of the name ‘Miduvilāla’ is not clear.

tra changes to nakkhatta<sup>510</sup> in Prakrit. Nakha and ṇakkha are
identical,<sup>511</sup> tta in nakkhatta changes to dda in sandhi here. The

Chittagong and Tippera.<sup>535</sup> K. L. Barua identifieds it with Kopili
valley in Assam.<sup>536</sup> Generally Ḍavāka is identified with modern
Daboka in Nowgong district, Assam.<sup>537</sup> It thus corresponds to
the valley of the Kapili and the Yamuna rivers in Nawgong
district where we still find a place called Doboka.<sup>538</sup>

3. {%Kāmarūpa%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states which were
subordinate to Samudragupta and whose emperors paid him
[Page-254+ 39]
taxes and all kinds of obeisance. Majumdar<sup>539</sup> identifies it with
Upper Assam. Kāmarūpa consisted of the Western districts of
the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state
and being the first to be approached from the western side
came to denote the whole valley.<sup>540</sup> The area of Kāmarūpa
was estimated by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang to have
been 10,000 li i. e. 1667 miles in circuit which shows that it
must have comprised the whole valley of Brahmaputra.<sup>541</sup>
Śaktisaṅgama describes<sup>542</sup> Kāmarūpa as extending from Kāle-
śvara to the Śvetagiri and from Tripura to the Nīla-parvata
(which is the Nilādri or Nīlakūṭa, the name of the Kāmākhyā
hill). According to the Yoginī Tantra, the kingdom of Kāma-
rūpa included the whole of the Brahmaputra valley together
with Rangpur and Cochbihar.<sup>543</sup> The Purāṇas mention Prāg-
jyotiṣa, identified with Kāmākhyā or Gauhati, as the capital of
Kāmarūpa.<sup>544</sup> The Kamauli grant of Vaidyadeva mentions
Kāmarūpa as a Maṇḍala of the Prāgjyotiṣa-bhukti.<sup>545</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Abhidhāna, the Vaijayantī and the Trikāṇḍaśeṣa in-
form us that Prāgjyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa were the same coun-
try.<sup>546</sup> In the Raghuvaṃśa,<sup>547</sup> the separate mention of Prāg-
jyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa may seem to be a little puzzling. But
we see that whereas verses 81-82 of the fourth canto refer to
the king of Prāgjyotiṣa as terrified, the subsequent verses
describe the presentation of elephants and the offer of respects
by the king of Kāmarūpa to Raghu. Thus all the four verses
are inter-linked and, the context also proves that Prāgjyotiṣa
and Kāmarūpa were the same.<sup>548</sup> The Buddhist Chronicle
Ārya-mañjuśrī-mūlakalpa describes Kāmarūpa as a country of
the east.<sup>549</sup> The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>550</sup> and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā<sup>551</sup>
also mention it in the same direction. Chatterji remarks that
the tribes living on the frontiers of Kāmarūpa were akin to the
Man tribes of South-Western China, a wild Tibeto-Chinese
people.<sup>552</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Ahoms of the Shan Tribe came into Assam at the be-
ginning of the 13th century due to the break-up of the Chinese
empire by the Moguls and ruled till the British occupation in
the beginning of the 19th century.<sup>553</sup>

4. {%Kāñcī%}¦ (No. I, L. 19):
The earliest epigraphic mention of Kāñcī is to be found in this
[Page-255+ 39]
inscription. The inscription refers to Viṣṇugopa of Kāñcī as
one of the kings of Dakṣiṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta
but reinstated in their kingdoms. Kāñcī is the same as Kāñcīpura
or modern Conjeevaram in the Chingleput district of Madras
Presidency.<sup>554</sup> The kingdom of Kāñcī extended from the mouth
of the Krishna to the south of the river Palar and sometimes
even to the Kaveri.<sup>555</sup> It is also known as Kāñcīpeḍu.<sup>556</sup> It is
mentioned in several early records relating to the ancient his-
tory of the Pallavas of Kāñcī (of about A.D. 250 to 355)<sup>557</sup> The
Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin, the Cālukya ruler in the 7th
century A.D. refers to his conquest of Kāñcīpura.<sup>558</sup> The ear-
liest literary reference to Kāñcī is in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañ-
jali.<sup>559</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhāṣya on Vārttika 26 to Pāṇini IV. 2. 104 men-
tions Kāñcīpuraka (i. e. a resident of Kāñcīpura).<sup>560</sup> Hiuen
Tsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li or 5 miles in circuit, and
that in the city there were eighty Deva temples and many here-
ties called Nirgranthas.<sup>561</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Purāṇas attach great importance to Kāñcī.<sup>562</sup> It is
included in a list of seven holy cities of India.<sup>563</sup> The Brah-
māṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>564</sup> associates Kāñcī with Kāśī, the two forming
the two eyes of Śiva. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya sūtra<sup>565</sup>
that Kāñcī is a Śākta-kṣetra. In the Devībhāgavata<sup>566</sup>, Kāñcī
is said to be a sthāna of the Devī called Annapūrṇā.<sup>567</sup> The
Vāmana Purāṇa<sup>568</sup> mentions it as the best among the cities.
The Skandapurāṇa<sup>569</sup> counts it amongst the holy places. The
Bhāgavatapurāṇa<sup>570</sup> and the Yoginītantra<sup>571</sup> also mention it.
In Daśakumāracaritam<sup>572</sup> it is referred to as a city of the Drāviḍa
country.
<div n="P"/>Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. Śiva Kāñcī and Viṣṇu
Kāñcī form the western and eastern parts of the city, while
the Jaina Kāñcī is known as Tiruparutti-Kunram.<sup>573</sup> Of the
temples at Conjeevaram, the most famous are the Kāmākṣī
temple with a Cakra placed in front of the deity, the Vaikuṇṭha
Perumal temple of Viṣṇu and the Śhiva temple of Kailā-
śanātha.<sup>574</sup>
<div n="P"/>Apart from its religious significance Kāñcī has been a
famous centre of learning. The Pallava ruler Mahendravarman,
the author of the Mattavilāsa-Prahasana; Bhāravi, the author
[Page-256+ 39]
of the Kirātārjunīyam and Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumār-
acaritam are said to have flourished here.<sup>575</sup>
<div n="P"/>The famous Buddhist dialectician Dinnāga came here to
satisfy his intellectual and spiritual thirst and about the middle
of the fourth century A.D., the brāhmaṇa Mayūraśaraman,
who founded the Kadamba line came here for getting recogni-
tion in Vedic learning.<sup>576</sup> The Ādi-guru Śaṅkarācārya establi-
shed here the famous Pīṭha known as Kāmakotipīṭha.<sup>577</sup>
Literally Kāñcī means a ‘girdle’. It seems to have been so
named because it is situated like a girdle round the sea.

5. {%Kāśī%}¦ (No. 28, L. 6):
It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the in-
scription a vihāra at Vaṭa-gohālī was inhabited by the disciples
of the Nigrantha preceptor (Śramaṇācārya) Guhanandin,
belonging to the Pañca-stūpa section (nikāya) of Kāśī.<sup>578</sup>
Evidently Vaṭagohālī was a seat of Jain monks who had their
major seat at Kāśī.
<div n="P"/>The name Kāśī is derived from the root Kaś ‘to shine’.
The Skandapurāṇa<sup>579</sup> says that the city of Kāśī became famous
by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvāṇa or
because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god Śiva shines
forth here.<sup>580</sup> B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read
sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it
with a certain kind of grass.<sup>581</sup> It has been known for centuries
under five different names, viz., Vārāṇasī (modern Banaras),
Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśma-
śāna.<sup>582</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of the Kāśīs as a tribal people occurs
in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda.<sup>583</sup> Vārāṇasī
was the capital of the people of Kāśī.<sup>584</sup> Thus it seems that
geographically Kāśī represented a larger area than Vārāṇasī, the
latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times
the position became just the reverse. Vārāṇasī comprehended
the entire district and Kāśī generally represented only a small
place. In a grant of Mahārāja Vināyakapāla we get a reference
to a village of Tikkarikā situated in the Pratiṣṭhāna-bhukti,
and attached to Kāśī-pāra-Pathaka which belonged to Vārāṇasī
viṣaya.<sup>585</sup> Kāśī pāra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient
city of the Kāśī.<sup>586</sup> The Vividhatīrthakalpa<sup>587</sup> also mentions
[Page-257+ 39]
Kāśī as a janapada in the Vārāṇasī City.
<div n="P"/>The ancient kingdom of Kāśī was bounded by Kośala on the
north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The
Cedis and Karuṣas lived to their south.<sup>588</sup> At the time of
Buddha, the kingdom of Kāśī was absorbed by the kingdom of
Kośala.<sup>589</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near
Kāśī in the Deer Park at Sārnāth. Kāśī was an important
Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in
the time of Aśoka.<sup>590</sup> During the period of Gupta rule it was
on its way to become a strong centre of Śiva worship with the
mahāliṅgas set up in different parts of the city.<sup>591</sup> The Purāṇas
include the region in the Gupta empire.<sup>592</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patañjali in
his Mahābhāṣya<sup>593</sup> mentions Kāśī cloth. The Buddhist litera-
ture gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.<sup>594</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kāśī has been a place of much importance for Hindu pil-
grimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length
in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. Lord Śiva never
leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta. A man who dies here
is believed to get emancipation.<sup>595</sup>

6. {%Kosala%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
It is spelt both ways with the dental as well as with the palatal
sibilant. It is included in the list of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms
whose kings were conquered but reinstated by Samudragupta.
At that time Mahendra was its ruler. It has been identified
with South Kosala corresponding to modern district of Raipur,
Sambalpur and Bilaspur of M.P. and Orissa.<sup>596</sup> Its old capital
was Śrīpura (modern Sirpur), 40 miles north-east of Raipur.<sup>597</sup> It
is the same as Mahā-kosala<sup>598</sup> which forms the largest unit among
the three component parts of the State of Madhya Pradesh.<sup>599</sup>
The recent excavation at Eraṇ has thrown a flood of new light
on the early history of eastern Malwa and Mahākosala between
the period 1900 B.C. and A.D. 600. During the Gupta period
several Brahmanical temples were built in this region. In the
early medieval period i. e. from A.D. 600 to 1200, the Candellas
and Kalacuris were the two chief ruling dynasties in the
Mahākosala area. In the period of Muslim rule followed by
Maratha supremacy, many forts and fortresses were built
[Page-258+ 39]
by the ruling chiefs<sup>600</sup> in different parts of Mahākosala.
Dakṣiṇa Kosala is mentioned in the Ratnāvalī (Act IV) as
having been conquered by Udayana, king of Vatsa.<sup>601</sup>
<div n="P"/>N.L. Dey<sup>602</sup> identifies Dakṣiṇa Kosala with Tosalī of
Aśoka's inscription (Tosala) at Dhauli, which is situated near
Bhuvaneśwar in the Puri district, Orissa. Sylvain Levi suggests
an Austric origin for this wold. ‘Kosala changing to Tosala is
an apparent variation of the initial due to the formative
prefix’<sup>603</sup> in the Austric languages. The country of Tosala also,
like Kosala, had two divisions: Uttara Tosala and Dakṣiṇa
Tosala.<sup>604</sup> Dakṣiṇa Tosala consisted of a maṇḍala of the name
of Koṅgoda. In some cases by mistake the reading Dakṣiṇa
kosala is given in place of Dakṣiṇa Tosala.<sup>605</sup> But it is clear
from other evidence that Tosala and Kosala were two separate
entities. The purāṇas mention them separately.<sup>606</sup> The Kāvya-
mīmāṃṣā also makes a separate reference to the two.<sup>607</sup>

It is mentioned as one of the Southern kingdoms conquered by
Samudragupta. Its ruler was Svāmidatta. It has been identified

Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra among the three chiefs of Kaliṅga
who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their
country.<sup>609</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Fleet Koṭṭūr (from Koṭṭapura) being a very
common Dravidian name, may be looked for in any Koṭṭūra
of note, in a mountainous part of Southern India, e. g. possibly
Koṭṭūr in the Coimbatore district, at the foot of one of the
passes in the Anaimalai Hills.<sup>610</sup> R. Sathianathaier proposes
to identify Koṭṭūra with Koṭṭūra near Tuni (E. Godavari dis-
trict) and maintains that Samudragupta did not pass through
Orissa, Ganjam and Vizagapatam<sup>611</sup> There is another
Koṭṭūra in the Vizagapatam district.<sup>612</sup> But the generally
accepted view is to identify it with Kothoor in Ganjam.

8. {%Kurāla%}¦ (No. I, L. 19):
It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Dakṣiṇāpatha
subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Maṇṭarāja. Fleet
suggests that Kaurālaka is a mistake for Kairalaka, denoting
the well known province Kerala in the South of India.<sup>613</sup>
D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>614</sup> identifies this Kerala with the Sonpur
[Page-259+ 39]
territory in C.P. round about Yayātinagara where the author
of the Pavanadūta locates the Keralas. Barnett identified it
with modern village Korāḍa in South India.<sup>615</sup> Kurāḷa is
taken by Kielhorn<sup>616</sup> to be the same as Kunāla mentioned in
the Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin II<sup>617</sup> and identified with
the Kolleru lake between the Godavari and the Krishna.<sup>618</sup>
But D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>619</sup> objects to this view on the ground
that the Kolleru lake must have been included in the kingdom
of Veṅgī mentioned later on<sup>620</sup> in the same list in the inscrip-
tion. G. Ramdas<sup>621</sup> seems to be right when he observes that
Kurāḷa must be the plain country of the Ganjam district to
the north-east of the Mahendra hill now chiefly occupied by
the Oriyas.

9. {%Nepāla%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
It is mentioned as one of the border states which accepted the
subordination of Samudragupta. Some take it to refer to
Tippera<sup>622</sup> which is doubtful.<sup>623</sup> The city is said to have been
founded by Ne ṛṣi who performed his religious services at the
junction of the Bāgmatī and Kesāvatī and who also ruled over
the country.<sup>624</sup> The Nepāla valley originally contained a lake
called Nāga Bāsa or Kālihrada, in which lived Nāga Karkoṭaka.
It was fourteen miles in length and four miles in breadth<sup>625</sup>
<div n="P"/>The former name of Nepāla was Śleṣmātakavana.<sup>626</sup> The
famous temple of Paśupatinātha on the western bank of the
Bāgmatī river, is situated about three miles north west of
Kathmandu in the town of Devipatan said to have been founded
by Aśoka's daughter Cārumatī.<sup>627</sup> The Śaktisaṅgama Tantra
describes the country of Nepāla as placed between Jaṭeśvara
and Yoginī.<sup>628</sup> Sircar equates Yoginīpura with Delhi and
Jaṭeśvara with Jalpeśvara, the famous Śiva of the Jalpaiguri
district in North Bengal.<sup>629</sup>
<div n="P"/>Nepāla was a buffer state in the 7th century A.D. In
the 8th century A.D. she shook of its domination by Tibet.<sup>630</sup>
According to the Deopara inscription, Nānyadeva, the ruler
of Nepāla, is said to have been defeated and imprisoned with
many other princes by Vijayasena, about the middle of the

identified with Palakkaḍa, the capital of a Pallava viceroyalty

identify Palakkaḍa with Palakalūru in the Guntur taluka.<sup>633</sup>

places Palakka in the Nellore district.<sup>635</sup> Dubreuil, however,
identifies Palakka with a capital of the same name which was
situated to the South of the Krishna and which is mentioned
in many Pallava Copper Plates.<sup>636</sup> The kingdom of Palakka
might have extended westwards beyond the region now occu-
pied by the districts of Auddepal and North Arcot.<sup>637</sup> It was
perhaps situated to the west of Kāñcī on the Eastern Ghāṭs.<sup>638</sup>

Kartṛpura’ gratified the imperious commands of Samudrgupta,
by giving all (kinds of) taxes and obeying (his) orders and
coming to perform obeisance.<sup>639</sup> We also find a reference to
Pratyanta in the Girnar Rock Edict No. 2. of Aśoka.<sup>640</sup>
<div n="P"/>Law<sup>641</sup> contrasts between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. He
takes Pratyanta to mean the Mleccha country and quotes the
Amarakośa, Divyāvadāna, Abhidhānacintāmaṇi and Smṛti-
candrikā.<sup>642</sup> But in the inscription<sup>643</sup> the contrast is between
Dakṣināpatha and Āryāvarta while the word Āṭavikarāja
breaks the link between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. Moreover,
all the border states mentioned in the inscription could not
have been Mleccha and inhabited by Kirātas.<sup>644</sup> The word
Pratyanta and its substitutes in the Aśokan edicts also refer to

It is one of the frontier kingdoms which offered their sub-
mission to Samudragupta.<sup>645</sup> Sen<sup>646</sup> remarks that Samudra-
gupta reduced the king of Samataṭa to the rank of a subordi-
nate prince who had to part with most of his powers and was
‘allowed to rule over a much reduced dominion as a vassal of
the emperor’. Retaining only the control of its internal ad-
ministration, he had to pay various kinds of taxes to Samudra-
gupta, attend his durbars, render obeisance to him and gratify
[Page-261+ 39]
his imperious commands.<sup>647</sup> Samataṭa is the only territory in
Bengal to be referred to in the Allahabed Praśasti.<sup>648</sup> The
first epigraphic reference to Samataṭa is to be found in this
inscription.<sup>649</sup> Literally the name means ‘the shore country’
or ‘Level country’.<sup>650</sup> ‘Samataṭa in the Gupta period denoted
a territory lying to the east of the Brahmaputra’. The Bṛhat-
saṃhitā mentions it as a country situated in the East.<sup>651</sup> The
Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang proceeded from Kāmarūpa
southwards and after a journey of 1,200 or 1,300 li (6 li-
1 mile) reached the country of Samataṭa. According to him,
this country was on the seaside and was low and moist and
was more than 3,000 li in circuit.<sup>652</sup> From Samataṭa, the
pilgrim journeyed towards the West for over 900 li and
reached Tanmolihti,<sup>653</sup> or Tāmralipta, the modern Tamluk in
the Midnāpur district.<sup>654</sup> Samataṭa, therefore, must have been
the South-eastern part of the Bengal presidency corresponding
to the Dacca, Faridpur, Backerganj, Jessore and Khulna
districts.<sup>655</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is known from the Baghaura Inscription<sup>656</sup> that the
Tipperah district was in Samataṭa. The Ārya-Mañjuśrī Mūla-
kalpa states that Samataṭa was situated to the east of the
Lohitya.<sup>657</sup> The Yādavaprakāśa equates Bhaurika with
Samataṭa.<sup>658</sup>
<div n="P"/>Epigraphical evidence, however, shows that Samataṭa com-
prised the districts of Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhat.<sup>659</sup> Its
capital Karmmanta has been identified with Baḍ-Kāmatā, 12
miles west of Comilla district.<sup>660</sup> After the rule of the Guptas,
Samataṭa was successively under the Khaḍga, Candra, Varman
and Sena dynasties.<sup>661</sup>

1. {%Āryāvartta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 12):
Samudragupta is stated to have violently exterminated many
kings of Āryāvarta such as Rudradeva, Matila, Nāgadatta,
Candravarman, Gaṇapatināga, Nāgasena, Acyuta, Nandin
and Balavarman.<sup>677</sup> We also find references to Āryāvarta in
other epigraphic records.<sup>678</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally Āryāvarta<sup>679</sup> means ‘the abode of the Āryas, or
excellent or noble people’. The word ‘Ārya’ here is significant.
<div n="P"/>It has been interpreted in two ways: some scholars derive
the word Ārya from the root §{%Ar,%} to plough, and suggest that
the Vedic Āryans were so called because they despised the
pursuits of agriculture and remained shepherds and hunters.<sup>680</sup>
<div n="P"/>“If {%Ārya%} were purely a racial term. a more probable deri-
vation would be {%Ar,%} meaning strength or valour, from §ar
to fight, whence we have the name of the Greek war-god Ares,
areios, brave or warlike, perhaps even arete, virtue signifying,
like the Latin virtues, first physical strength and courage and
then moral force and elevation”.<sup>681</sup> “Intrinsically, in its most
fundamental sense, Ārya means an effort or an uprising or
overcoming. The Āryan is he who strives and overcomes all
outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human
advance.”<sup>682</sup> Wilson says that a variety of ancient designations
of which ‘Āria’ is a component element (cf. Ariāna) are con-
nected with the term Ārya. The Zend name for the country
to the west of the Indus was ‘Eriene-veejo’, that is the Sans-
krit Āryāvarta.<sup>683</sup>
<div n="P"/>In defining the boundaries of Āryāvarta, Vasiṣṭha and
Baudhāyana in their Dharmasūtras lay stress on the word
Ārya and explain it to mean {%śiṣṭa.%} Patañjali also in his Mahā-
[Page-264+ 39]
bhāṣya first explains the meaning of {%śiṣṭa%} in order to draw
attention to the cultural basis of the name Āryāvarta. He
remarks that correct conduct is found in Āryāvarta and then
mentions its boundaries.<sup>684</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇa period the centre of Āryan culture and ci-
vilization shifted to the Gangetic Doab “Āryāvarta came to be
treated as conterminous with the region between the Gaṅgā
and Yamunā.<sup>685</sup> In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>686</sup> special honour
is assigned to those who dwell between the Gaṅgā and the
Yamunā. In the Śutra period Āryāvarta extended from the
hills of Central Rajasthan to the hills of Central Bihar.<sup>687</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the time of Patañjali,<sup>688</sup> Āryāvarta was bounded on the
north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pāriyātraka, on the
west by Ādarśāvalī and on the east by Kālakavana (Rajmahal
hills) ‘Black Forest’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardwar.<sup>689</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus it seems that Āryāvarta bore a sacerdotal sense and
denoted a particularly limited area where Āryan institutions
were the basis of social order.<sup>690</sup>
<div n="P"/>What was originally called Āryāvarta was later named as
Madhya-deśa and Āryāvarta came to include the whole of
Northern India. This is related to the gradual spread of Ārya-
nism.<sup>691</sup> Brahmāvarta and Brahmarṣideśa lost their identity in
the Madhya-deśa and combined with Prācya, Pratīcya and
Udīcya (Uttarāpatha) became the equivalent of Āryāvarta.<sup>692</sup>
Both Udīcya and Prācya were taken as the home (loka) of
standard Sanskrit both in Pāṇini's time and earlier. In the time
of Patañjali, Āryāvarta came to be regarded as the home of the
Śiṣṭas (persons proficient in the Śāstras) whose language set the
norm.<sup>693</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the second century A.D., the last limit of the composi-
tion of the Manu-smṛti, the wider outlook of Āryāvarta was
popular. It was the name of the tract extending from the
Eastern to the Western Ocean, and bounded on the north and
south by the Himalaya and Vindhya respectively.<sup>694</sup> This is
supported by the Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara.<sup>695</sup> Rājaśek-
hara speaks of the river Narmadā as the dividing line between
Āryāvarta and the Dakṣiṇāpatha.<sup>696</sup> In Inscription No. 1, L. 29
Āryāvarta is contrasted with Dakṣiṇāpatha, ‘the southern
region’.<sup>697</sup> The wider sense of Āryāvarta is also supported by
[Page-265+ 39]
references in the Abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi<sup>698</sup> and the Rājataraṅ-
giṇī.<sup>699</sup>

2. {%Kākanādaboṭa%}¦ (No. 5, L. 1; No. 23, L. 2):
In both the inscriptions, we find reference to a grant to the
Ārya Saṃgha or the Community of the faithful, at the great
Vihāra, or Buddhist convent of Kākanādaboṭa,<sup>700</sup> for the
purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps.
<div n="P"/>D.C. Sircar takes ‘Kākanādaboṭa’ to be the old name of
Sāñcī.<sup>701</sup> Fleet is of the view that the Kākanādaboṭa convent
is the Great Stūpa itself. According to him the word Boṭa is
another form of Poṭa which means ‘the foundation of a
house’.<sup>702</sup> Fleet further writes that the name ‘Kākanāda’ lit.
‘the noise of the crow’ was the ancient name of Sāñcī itself
which is proved by its occurrence in two inscriptions in Mauryan
characters found at Sāñcī.<sup>703</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus, it is clear that Kākanāda was the ancient name of
Sāñcī in the Bhopal State, now Raisen district, Madhya
Pradesh, well-known for its Buddhist topes.<sup>704</sup> The word ‘boṭa’
is thus a surplus and joined by ‘Kākanāda’ will refer to the
great stūpa itself. Its form Poṭa meaning the foundation of a
house is untenable because the word ‘vihāra’ in that very sense
appears in the inscriptions. The word ‘boṭa’ has been used here
in the sense of an ascetic cult.<sup>705</sup> It is a Prakrit word which has
been used here to refer to ‘the Buddhist cult’. Thus the relevant
expression means ‘in the holy great vihāra of the Buddhist cult
(assembly) at Kākanāda’.
<div n="P"/>Fleet is wrong in translating the word Kākanāda to mean
‘the noise of the crow’.<sup>706</sup> K.P. Jayaswal's rendering ‘the praise
of the Kākas’<sup>707</sup> is more to the point. We know of the Kākas,
an autonomous community mentioned in the Allahabad In-
scription of Samudragupta.<sup>708</sup> In Eastern Malwa we have two
ancient place-names connected with the Kākas. One is the hill
now called Sāñcī hill (the ancient) Kākanāda. The other is an
ancient village called Kāka-pura, some 20 miles north of
Bhilsa, and full of ancient monuments.<sup>709</sup>

<L>466<pc>265<k1>उत्तरकुरु<k2>उत्तरकुरु
3. {%Uttara Kuru%}¦ (No. 22, L. 7):
A person named Śaṃkara is described in the inscription as
born in the region of the north, the best of countries, which
resembles (in beatitude) the land of the Northern Kurus.<sup>710</sup>
[Page-266+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The Kurus had two branches, the northern and the southern.
Uttarakuru or the country of the Northern Kurus, is supposed
to be a region beyond the most northern range of the Himālaya
mountains, and is described as a country of everlasting hap-
piness.<sup>711</sup> We have discussed in details, the Kurus, in the
section on tribes. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>712</sup> mentions it as a country
situated in the North. In the later period the Uttarakurus had
only a mythical or legendary existence.

<L>467<pc>266<k1>वङ्ग<k2>वङ्ग
4. {%Vaṅga%}¦ (No. 20, L. I):
In this inscription, king Candra, “on whose arm fame was
inscribed by the sword, when in battle in Vaṅga countries, is
stated to have kneaded, back with his breast the enemies who,
uniting together, came against him”.<sup>713</sup> This is taken by
scholars<sup>714</sup> to be the first epigraphic mention of Vaṅga. The
Vaṅgas here mean the ‘Vaṅga country’ the eastern Bengal of
modern times. Bajpai is of the opinion that the Vaṅgas
of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription of Candra (No. 20) are the
people living in the Makaran coast of Baluchistan.<sup>715</sup> But the
Vaṅgas here denote country and not the people. Moreover, the
victory of king Candra over the Vaṅga countries has no con-
nection with his conquest of the Vāhlikas. Both are separately
mentioned in his campaign. In Sanskrit the tribal name in the
plural is regularly used to indicate the country inhabited by the
tribe.<sup>716</sup> The Vaṅga countries are also referred to in the
Mahākūṭa Pillar Inscription,<sup>717</sup> but in the inscriptions after
the 9th century A.D. the word Vaṅgāla is usually mention-
ed.<sup>718</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of the Vaṅgas along with the Magadhas
is in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>719</sup> The name is also found in the
Baudhāyana Dharma-Sūtra<sup>720</sup> where the Vaṅgas are mentioned
as impure people.<sup>721</sup> But the Drama ‘Pratijñā-Yaugandha-
rāyaṇa’ (Act II), ascribed to Bhāsa and probably not older
than the 4th century A.D., suggests that the ruling families of
Bengal were regarded as equals to those of Northern India for
intermarriage with the royal family of Mālava.<sup>722</sup>
<div n="P"/>The people of Vaṅga are stated to have fought in the Kuru-
kshetra war<sup>723</sup> and, in course of his expedition Bhīṣma is said
to have defeated Samudrasena of Vaṅga.<sup>724</sup> The Kāśikā men-
tions Vāṅgaka to explain Pāṇini's sūtra (IV. 3. 100) denoting
[Page-267+ 38]
loyalty of the citizen to the state.<sup>725</sup> Pāṇini mentions Vāṅgī
(the lady of Vaṅga Janapada) along with Avantī, Kurū and
Yaudheyī.<sup>726</sup> Patañjali also refers to the Vaṅgas by way of
illustration.<sup>727</sup> Kauṭilya makes similar references to the
country.<sup>728</sup> The Bhāgavata Purāṇa also mentions it as a
country.<sup>729</sup> Kālidāsa states that Raghu after conquering the
Sumhas,<sup>730</sup> defeated the Vaṅgas with his force.<sup>731</sup> The Kāvya-
mīmāṃsā mentions Vaṅga as a janapada situated in the east.<sup>732</sup>
The Bṛhatsaṃhitā also mentions it in the east along with Upa-
Vaṅga.<sup>733</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Mahābhārata<sup>734</sup> Vaṅga, son of Bali, had
established this country. The Amarakośa<sup>735</sup> mentions Vaṅga
as a synonym of Raṅga (lead), but lead is not available
in Bengal and is found in abundance in Malaya, Pegu and
East Indies. People in other parts of India may have received
lead through the people of East Bengal. Suśruta also uses
Vaṅga in the same sense as Amara does<sup>736</sup>
<div n="P"/>R.C. Banerji<sup>737</sup>, on the basis of the Ablur Inscription of the
Kalacuri king Bijjala<sup>738</sup> takes Vaṅga and Vaṅgāla as two dis-
tinct people or tribes. This view has been correctly refuted by
S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>739</sup> who concludes that Vaṅgāla was within Vaṅga
and hence was not altogether a separate geographical entity
as is maintained by some.
<div n="P"/>The confusion may be due to the fact that the geographi-
cal location of the Vaṅga country changed in different periods.
The same country Vaṅga was known as Vaṅgāla with the addi-
tion of the Prakrit suffix {%‘āla’%}<sup>740</sup> which was transliterated by the
Muslims as Bangālah (pronouncing Bangāla) in their script<sup>741</sup>
and this was changed into Bengal by the English people.
<div n="P"/>The Yādavaprakāśa equates Vaṅga with Harikeli<sup>742</sup> but
the Kalpadrukośa, a work of the seventeenth century states that
Śrīhaṭṭa is Harikeli.<sup>743</sup> The commentary of Yaśodhara on the
Kāmasūtra refers to Vaṅga as situated to the east of the
Brahmaputra.<sup>744</sup>

<P>There are two possible explanations: ‘Between Cūḍāmaṇinagara and
Śrīnauyoga’, or between the nauyogas (places for parking boats) of
Cūḍāmaṇi and Nagaraśrī...Hz., p. 344, f. n. 4. The second explanation
is more plausible. If we take the first explanation then it may mean ‘at
the town of Cūḍāmaṇi’, the ephithet śrī is then ill construed with
nauyoga. Moreover, we know from line 29 of the inscription, nauyoga
as an epithet for Praḍāmāra. So nauyoga is the epithet here and
Cūḍāmaṇi and Nagaraśrī are two place-names here.

1. {%Gaṅgā%}¦ (No. 1, L. 31, No. 13, L. 16):
In Inscription No. 1 Samudragupta's fame has been compared
with the pale yellow water of the river Gaṅgā, which travelling
by many paths, purifies the three worlds, flowing quickly on
being liberated from confinement in the thickets of the matted
hair of (the) god Paśupati.<sup>1</sup> In the Mandasor inscription of
Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana<sup>2</sup> it is stated that when the
river Gaṅgā was about to descend from heaven to earth, in
order to break the force of its fall, god Śiva (Paśupati) received
it in the matted hair coiled above his forehead and projecting
like a horn; its waters wandered there for a thousand years,
before they eventually reached the earth.
<div n="P"/>In Inscription No. 13, we get a reference to Gaṅgā in the
context of Skandagupta's fight with the Hūṇas, the noise of
which was heard like the roaring of (the river) Gaṅgā, making
itself noticed in their ears.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>A.C. Woolner<sup>4</sup> remarked that the name Gaṅgā does not
seem to have a convincing derivation on the Āryan side. But
we do find the word in the Uṇādi affixes. The affix Gan
comes after the root Gaṃ ‘to go’ and the word Gaṅgā is
formed.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of Gaṅgā is in the Ṛgveda.<sup>6</sup> The name
also occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> and the Taittirīya
Āraṇyaka.<sup>8</sup> We find it also in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya,<sup>9</sup> and
in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>10</sup> It is mentioned many times in
the Purāṇas<sup>11</sup> in which a good deal of religious importance is
attached to it.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Gaṅgā emerges first in the Gangotri in the district of
[Page-294+ 39]
Garhwal and proceeds in different courses from Hardwar to
Bulandshahar and from Allahabad to Rajmahal from where it
enters Bengal.<sup>13</sup>

2. {%Hacāta Gaṅga%}¦ (No. 52, L. 31):
We find the mention of Hacāta Gaṅga in inscription No. 52,
but it is difficult to identify it. It may, however, be remarked
here that the word Gaṅga is to be taken in the sense of a
river.<sup>14</sup>

Sen considers it to be the name of a river.<sup>15</sup> It has been
described as the name of one of the seven arms of the heavenly
Gaṅgā.<sup>16</sup> We also know of a Jambūnadī as a vīthī in the Gayā
Viṣaya mentioned in the Nālandā plate of Dharmapāladeva.<sup>17</sup>

4. {%Kālindī%}¦ (No. 18 L. 3):
According to the inscription in the reign of Budhagupta, his
feudatory, Mahārāja Suraśmicandra was governing the country
lying between the river Kālindī and Narmadā.<sup>18</sup> Kālindī is
the same as the river Yamunā.<sup>19</sup> The Yamunā has got its
source from the Kalindadeśa, a mountainous country situated
in the Bāndarapuccha range or the Himālaya and hence the
river is called Kālindī.<sup>20</sup> In the Purāṇas we get the earlier
mention of Kālindī by both the names, Kālindī as well as
Yamunā.<sup>21</sup> The Kālindī is also mentioned in the Śiśupālavadha
of Māga.<sup>22</sup>
<LEND>

<L>472<pc>294<k1>नर्मदा<k2>नर्मदा
5. {%Narmadā%}¦ (No. 18, L. 3):
The above-mentioned inscription describes reign of Mahārāja
Suraśmicandra, a feudatory of Budhagupta, as governing over
the area between the rivers Kālindī and Narmadā.<sup>23</sup> This is
one of the earliest inscriptional references to the river Nar-
madā.<sup>24</sup> It is mentioned as Narmados by Ptolemy.<sup>25</sup> No ex-
press reference to the Narmadā can be traced in the Vedic
literature. But the knowledge of the river is implied in the
reference to a chief Revottaras mentioned in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>26</sup> We find from the Amarakośa<sup>27</sup> that Revā is
another name of the river Narmadā. It is likely that the
name of the chief was derived from his association with the
river.<sup>28</sup> The Raghuvaṃśa speaks of Mahiṣmatī as the capital
of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā).<sup>29</sup> It has
been mentioned several times in the Mahābhārata and the
[Page-295+ 39]
Purāṇas.<sup>30</sup> The Viṣṇupurāṇa says that by chanting a mantra
addressed to the Narmadā, one does not have any fear from
serpents.<sup>31</sup> The river rises in the Amarakaṇṭaka mountain and
falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The junction of the Narmadā
with the sea is a sacred place of pilgrimage.<sup>32</sup> According to
the Purāṇas it flows from a Ṛkṣvat (a part of the Vindhyan
range) though some of them refer to it arising directly from
the Vindhya itself.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is stated in the Kūrma and Matsya Purāṇas that a man
who commits suicide at any tīrtha on the Narmadā or on the
Amarakaṇṭaka does not return to this world.<sup>34</sup> Several rivers
such as Kapilā, Viśalyā, Eraṇḍī, Ikṣunadī and Kāverī<sup>35</sup> are
mentioned as falling into the Narmadā.

<L>473<pc>295<k1>पद्मा<k2>पद्मा
6. {%Padmā%}¦ (No. 16, L. 5):
The inscription No. 16 refers to a brāhmaṇa named Devaviṣṇu,
who belonged to the community of Caturvedins of Padmā of
the town of Indrapura.<sup>36</sup> The Gaṅgā is also known as Padmā
or Paddā.<sup>37</sup> The community of the brāhmaṇas mentioned in
the inscription might have lived by the side of the river.
D.C. Sircar takes Padmā to be the name of a locality in the
town of Indrapura.<sup>38</sup> The inscription (No. 16) also tells us
that Skandagupta's feudatory viṣayapati Śarvanāga was govern-
ing Antarvedi or the country lying between the Gaṅgā and the
Yamunā.<sup>39</sup>

<L>474<pc>295<k1>पलाशिनी<k2>पलाशिनी
7. {%Palāśinī<sup>40</sup>%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
This river Palāśinī issues from the mountain Raivataka. On
account of the flood it had swollen. The poet, in describing
the scene says that the river had gone to join the sea. Palāśinī
is described as emanating from the mountain Ūrjayat (i. e. the
same as Raivataka).<sup>41</sup> We find another Palāśinī, (mod. Parās),
a tributary of the Koel in Choṭānagpur.<sup>42</sup> It seems that the
river was decorated with numerous Palāśa (flower) trees that
grew on its banks. The flowers falling in the river must have
given it the name of Palāśinī.<sup>43</sup>
<LEND>

<L>475<pc>295<k1>सिकता<k2>सिकता
8. {%Sikatā<sup>44</sup>%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
The river Sikatā takes its source from the mountain Raivataka.
It is the same as Suvarṇa-sikatā mentioned in the Junāgaṛh
Rock Inscription of Rudradāman.<sup>45</sup> This Sikatā or Suvarṇasi-
katā is to be identified with modern Soṇarekhā.<sup>46</sup> The name
[Page-296+ 39]
Suvaṇṇarehā (Suvarṇarekhā) is also met with in Vividhatīr-
thakalpa.<sup>47</sup> Thus the first part of the river's name has remained
unchanged for about two thousand years. The second part has
been replaced by a new one. The exact derivative as suggested
by Chatterji will be a form like Sonasītā or Sonasī.<sup>48</sup> The river
was named Suvarṇasikatā because its sand contains particles of
gold.<sup>49</sup>
<LEND>

<L>476<pc>296<k1>सिन्धु<k2>सिन्धु
9. {%Sindhu%}¦ (No. 20, L. 2):
The river is mentioned in connexion with the description of
the victories of king Candra who is said to have conquered the
Vāhlikas after having crossed the seven mouths of the (river)
Sindhu<sup>50</sup> in warfare. Sindhu in the Ṛgveda<sup>51</sup> and the Athar-
vaveda<sup>52</sup> often means simply a ‘stream’. The Ṛgveda (VIII.
24. 27) refers to ‘Sapta Sindhavaḥ’ or ‘the seven rivers’.<sup>53</sup> But
it is also<sup>54</sup> used in the more exact sense of the ‘stream’ par
excellence or ‘The Indus’. We get a reference to Sindhu as a
river in the Amara-kośa.<sup>55</sup> The territories adjoining it were
famous for horses<sup>56</sup> and salt.<sup>57</sup>
<div n="P"/>The term Sindhu was corrupted to Hindu in the old Per-
sian inscriptions of Darius I (516-485 B.C.), and to Indus by
the Ionian (= Pāṇini's Yavana) Greeks.<sup>58</sup> The word ‘India’ is
derived from the river Sindhu or the Indus.<sup>59</sup> Taking its rise
from the snows of Western Kailāśa in Tibet, the Sindhu first
flows north-west of Kashmir and South of little Pamir, and
then takes a southward course along which lay some of the
important cities of north India. Emerging from the Darad
high-lands, the river (Dāradī Sindhuḥ) enters the Gandhāra
country until it receives its most important western tributary
the Kabul river at Ohind, a few miles north of Attock.<sup>60</sup>
<div n="P"/>The river Sindhu is mentioned in the Purāṇas along with
the Gaṅgā, Sarasvatī, Satluj, Chinab and Yamunā.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vogel suggests that the expression ‘Sindhor sapta mukhāni’
may indicate the ‘sapta sindhavaḥ’ of the Ṛgveda, i. e. the
river Indus and its tributaries. The term mukha would then
be not taken in the sense of ‘the mouth of a river’, but as
meaning a river-head.<sup>62</sup> But the translation of the expression
as done by Fleet (i. e. the seven mouths of the river Indus) is
generally accepted.<sup>63</sup> The seven mouths of the river Indus
thus represent the points of its confluence with its tributaries
[Page-297+ 39]
and not the tributaries individually as suggested by Vogel.

<L>477<pc>297<k1>सुदर्शन<k2>सुदर्शन
10. {%Sudarśana%}¦ (No. 14, L. 15: L. 17):
It is the name of a lake situated at some distance from
Girinagara as mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of
Rudradāman I (A.D. 150).<sup>64</sup> The lake was originally cons-
tructed by the Vaiśya Puṣyagupta, the provincial governor of
the Maurya king Candragupta. Later on during the reign of
Aśoka it was adorned with conduits, by the Yavana governor
Tuṣāspha.<sup>65</sup> The same lake was destroyed by the excessive
floods in the Suvarṇasikatā, Palāśinī and other streams arising
from the mountain Ūrjayat.<sup>66</sup> By a breach, four hundred and
twenty cubits long, just as much broad, (and) seventy-five
cubits deep, all the water flowed out, so that, the lake, almost
like a sandy desert became extremely ugly to look at.<sup>67</sup> The
lake was immediately beautified with repairs by king Rudradā-
man.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>Inscription No. 14 informs us that during the reign of
Gupta king Skandagupta in the year 136 (G. E.), due to heavy
continuous rains the Sudarśana lake burst out on all sides<sup>69</sup>
and had the appearance of a sea. Eventually, contrary to the
literal meaning of its name the Sudarśana became ugly to look
at.<sup>70</sup> The lake was repaired in the year 137 (G. E.)<sup>71</sup> (= A.D.
456) by Cakrapālita, who was appointed governor of Giri-
nagara by his father Parṇadatta, who was Skandagupta's
viceroy in Surāṣṭra.<sup>72</sup>

11. {%Vāṭā-nadī%}¦ (No. 43, L. 22):
We get a reference to the Vāṭā-nadī in an inscription at Kalai-
kuri, Sultānpur near Naogaon, Rajshahi district, East Pakistan
now Bangla Desh. It was flowing to the east of a village
named Dhānyapāṭalikā.
<div n="P"/>‘The Vāṭā nadī appears to be the modern Bārā-nai, Singra
lying about 10 miles to the north-east of its junction with the
Atrai.<sup>73</sup> It flows west to east through the southern part of the
Rajshahi district<sup>74</sup>

12. {%Vilāsinī<sup>75</sup>%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
The river comes out from the mountain Raivataka. Fleet
takes Sikatāvilāsinī as an adjective of the Palāśinī<sup>76</sup> but the
three, Sikatā, Vilāsinī and Palāśinī seem to be separate rivers
as we find the use of the plural number in the case which
[Page-298+ 38]
denotes the mention of more than two rivers. Hence Vilāsinī
is the third river in the context: the other two being Pilāśinī
and Sikatā (Suvarṇasikatā).

1. {%Kailāśa%}¦ (No. 17, L. 6: L. 13):
In L. 6 of the inscription the poet while giving an account of
the city of Daśapura describes its buildings as lofty like the
mountain Kailāśa itself.<sup>77</sup> L. 13 describes the mountain Kāilaśa
as one of the breasts of the earth (the other being Sumeru) which
was being reigned over by the Gupta king Kumāragupta.<sup>78</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kailāśa mountain is situated about 25 miles to the north of
Māna-sarovara beyond Gangrī and to the east of the Niti
Pass.<sup>79</sup> The Mahābhārata<sup>80</sup> includes the Kumaun and Garhwal
mountains in the Kailāśa range. The mountain also known
as Hemakūṭa, Śaṃkaragiri and is to be identified with the
Aṣṭapada mountain of the Jainas.<sup>81</sup> It surpasses in beauty the
big Gurlā or any other of the Indian Himālaya.<sup>82</sup> Traditionally
it is supposed to be the habitat of Śiva and Pārvatī.<sup>83</sup>

2. {%Raivataka%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16) (the same as Ūrajayat see
Ūrjayat):
Raivataka is also mentioned in the Ādi-Parvan of the Mahā-
bhārata,<sup>84</sup> the Vividhatīrthakalpa,<sup>85</sup> the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,<sup>86</sup> the
Dohad Stone Inscription of Mahamūda,<sup>87</sup> and the Jaunpur In-
scription of Iśānavarman.<sup>88</sup> Its modern name Girnar was a
switch over to it from the city name Girinagara, i. e., ‘a city
on or at the foot of a hill’.<sup>89</sup> Raivataka derives its name
from king Revatā, the father of Revatī, (the wife of Baladeva,
Kṛṣṇa's elder brother).<sup>90</sup> Revata is supposed to have come
there from Dwārakā and lived on the hill. There is still a
tank called Revatī-kuṇḍa near Dāmodarakuṇḍa in the gorge
of the hill.<sup>91</sup> The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Māgha in the Śiśu-
pālavadha devotes the whole of Canto IV (verses 1-68) to the
description of the Raivataka mountain. In Canto VI (verses
1-79) the poet describes the occurrence of six seasons one by
one at the mountain Raivataka.

<L>482<pc>298<k1>सुमेरु<k2>सुमेरु
3. {%Sumeru%}¦ (No. 17, L. 13, No. 32, L. 15):
In No. 17 the mountain Sumeru is described as one of the
breasts of the earth (the other being Kailāśa) and the Gupta
[Page-299+ 39]
king Kumāragupta is mentioned as the lord of the earth. In
No. 32 it has been named as Amarabhūdhara. Its other names
are Meru, Karṇikācala, Ratnasānu, Svargiri, Svargigiri and
Kāñcanagiri.<sup>92</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sumeru is identified with Rudra Himālaya in Garhwal,
where the river Gaṅgā has its source, it is near Badarikāśrama.<sup>93</sup>
According to the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>94</sup> the Sumeru Parvata is
bounded on the north by Uttara-Kuru, on the South by
Bhāratavarṣa, on the west by Ketumāla and on the east by
Bhadrāśvavarṣa.<sup>95</sup> It is also mentioned in the Padmapurāṇa.<sup>96</sup>
and the Kālikāpurāṇa.<sup>97</sup> According to the Kālikāpurāṇa Śiva saw
the summit of it. We also learn from this text that the Jambu
river flows from this mountain.<sup>98</sup> We also find the mention of
the Meru in the Śiśupālavadha of Māgha. It was on account
of the eminence of Sumeru among the mountains that for
praising kings they were described as ‘Meru’ among kings.<sup>99</sup>
This metaphor may have been applied after the contention of
the Purāṇas that the earth is supposed to be like lotus, with
four Mahādvīpas as its four petals and mount Meru as its
pericarp.<sup>100</sup>
<LEND>

<L>483<pc>299<k1>ऊर्जयत्<k2>ऊर्जयत्
4. {%Ūrjayat%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
The poet here draws a picture: the lake Sudarśana looked
like the sea<sup>101</sup> and the rivers Palāśinī, (Suvarṇasikatā), etc.,
had joined it has if the mountain Ūrjayat had stretched his
hand with flowers (growing on the banks of the trees and thus
falling in the rivers) for sending his daughters to their worthy
husband.<sup>102</sup> Since the rivers emerged out from the mountain
Raivataka, it may be called their father as described in verse
28, but to avoid repetition the poet uses in verse 29 a synonym
of its name viz., the Ūrjayat and while making it the symbol
of father represents the sea as the husband of the rivers.<sup>103</sup>
Thus the mountains Ūrjayat and the Raivataka are one and
the same. We also get support for our suggestion from the
fact that whereas the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradā-
man describes the emergence of the rivers Palāśinī, Suvarṇsi-
katā etc., from the mountain Ūrjayat<sup>104</sup> in Inscription No. 14
the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.<sup>105</sup> Fleet<sup>106</sup>
and Sircar<sup>107</sup> are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill diff-
erent from Ūrjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The
[Page-300+ 40]
Vividhatīrthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the
Ujjayant (Ūrjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sancti-
fied by Śrīnemi and is situated in Surāṣṭra (South Kathia-
wad).<sup>108</sup> In another inscription at Girnār (about 15th century)
verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girnār by both the names
Ujjayanata and Raivata.<sup>109</sup> The Abhidhānacintāmaṇi of
Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as
synonyms.<sup>110</sup> The Kap copper-plate of Keṭadi Sadāśiva-Nāyaka
also refers to Ujjantagiri (Ūrjayat).<sup>111</sup> The mountain Ūrjayat
is identified with Girnar hill near Junāgaṛh.<sup>112</sup> The literal
meaning of Ūrjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.<sup>113</sup>

5. {%Viṣṇupada%}¦ (No. 20, L. 6):
<div n="P"/>We know from the inscription that a lofty standard of the
divine Viṣṇu was set up on the hill called Viṣṇupada.<sup>114</sup> Liter-
ally meaning ‘the hill marked with footprints of Viṣṇu’, Viṣṇu-
pada hill has been identified with that part of the Delhi Ridge
on which the column stands.<sup>115</sup> But there is no mountain in
Delhi and the inscription appears to have been brought there
from the mount Viṣṇupada.<sup>116</sup> On the evidence from the
Epics, this Viṣṇupada hill is not far from Kurukshetra and the
Beas.<sup>117</sup>

<P>We have seen from the Place-names discussed earlier that
they were named either after some hero, just as Gayā from
Gayāsura, Nepāla from the name of “Ne” ṛṣi, or after deities
just as Piṣṭapura, named after Piṣṭapurikā goddess. Other
examples are Indrapura named after God Indra, Devarāṣṭra
named after some unspecified god. Some places were named after
number, just as Koṭivarṣa, Pañcakulyavāpaka, Pañcanagarī. The
other category of place-names includes names derived either
from some natural surrounding just as Trivṛtā, having (good)
surroundings on the three sides; Vaṭodaka, surrounded by water;
Kṛmilā, full of kṛmis or insects; Tumbavana, abounding in
Tumba plants; or from the name of a tree just as Vaṭagohālī,
Palāśavṛndaka, Lavaṅgasikā (the clove tree); Eraṇḍapalla,
named after Eraṇḍa plant. In some cases the names point out
the geographical situation, just as Ādyapatha, Uttaramaṇḍala,
Dakṣiṇāpatha, Dakṣiṇāṃśaka-vīthi, Vindhyāṭavī, Goṣāṭa-
puñjaka, Airikiṇa, Saṃgohālikagrāma, Surāṣṭra, Kāñcī,
Doṅgā-grāma, Samataṭa.
<P>The place names were named after Tribes just as Puṇḍra-
vardhana named after the Puṇḍras; Vaṅga after Vaṅgas;
Āryāvarta after the Āryyas; Kākanādaboṭa after the Kākas;
Mūlanāgiraṭṭa and Nāgiraṭṭamaṇḍala after the Nāgas. Some
place-names seem to have been based on proper names, e. g.
Midu-vilāla-kṣetra, Jolārī-kṣetra, Mahipāla-kṣetra, Pakkavilāla-
kṣetra.
<P>The second part of the geographical names is a place-name
suffix which usually denotes the size or the nature of the
place. The examples are the suffixes pura, pallī, rāṣṭra, rājya,
Pradeśa, Deśa, Nagara, Varṣa, Viṣaya, bhukti, maṇḍala,
nauyoga, patha, kṣetra, gohālī, puṣkariṇī, vīthi, pottaka,
pāṭaka, pārśvika. We have found some place-names which
may be categorised as the abbreviated place-names. Either
[Page-306+ 4]
the suffix has been submerged in the name due to the
prakritisation or it has been dropped. The examples are
Ḍavāka, Kuṛāla, Avamukta, Nepāla, Palakka, Veṅgī, Kṛmilā,
etc.

<H>APPENDIX — I
<H>A NOTE ON THE KING CANDRA OF THE MEHARAULI
IRON PILLAR INSCRIPTION
<P>This iron pillar bearing the inscription of Candra was
originally erected on a hill called Viṣṇupada near the Beas,
but was brought to Meharaulī (Delhi) and was installed near
the well-known Kutub Minar.<sup>1</sup> We also know of the transfer
of the Aśokan pillars from Topra and Meerut to Delhi.<sup>2</sup>
<P>Though many scholars<sup>3</sup> have tried to identify Candra of
this inscription, it remains a baffling problem. The generally
accepted view is to identify him with Candragupta II.<sup>4</sup>
<P>Goyal<sup>5</sup> has identified Candra with Samudragupta. His
argument is that the original name of the king was not Candra
and in his support he quotes Fleet<sup>6</sup> and Allan. His second
contention is that whereas there is no evidence to prove that
Candragupta II had any military success in Bengal, we have a
positive reference in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription to
Samataṭa, Ḍavāka and Kāmarūpa as the bordering (pratyanta)
states of Samudragupta's empire. Goyal further argues that
Candragupta II had suzerainty over Daivaputraṣāhiṣāhānuṣāhis
who ruled in that region. He also points out that Samudra-
gupta had advanced victoriously to the south as far as Kāñcī
while Candragupta II can at best be credited with matrimonial
alliances or diplomatic activities alone in the South. Following
Majumdar, Mookerji and Agrawala he holds that Candrapra-
kāśa, son of Candragupta mentioned by the rhetorician Vāmana
was no other than Samudragupta and thus concludes that
Candra was another name of Samudragupta.
<P>We cannot accept Goyal's view since his arguments stand
on a weak edifice. We shall refute them one by one.
<P>Fleet<sup>7</sup> was mislead by the reading ‘Dhāvena’ in line 6
which seems to be ‘Bhāvena’ as suggested by some scholars.
[Page-310+ 39]
A perusal of the passage does not leave any doubt about Candra
being the original name of the king. Allan followed by Goyal<sup>8</sup>
describes it as a ‘poetical allusion’. But that does not mean
that the king had any name other than Candra. The poet
shows that his name was quite in consonance with his qual-
ities.<sup>9</sup> It is no doubt a poetic way of referring to his patron's
name. We have a similar instance in the Mandasor Inscription
of the Mālava Year 524 (A.D. 467). <sup>10</sup> Moreover, the reading in
line 6 of the inscription is clearly ‘Bhāvena’ and not Dhāvena.<sup>11</sup>
<P>We know that only a part of Bengal, i. e. Samataṭa was
conquered by Samudragupta; Davāka and Kāmarūpa being in
Assam, their subjugation does mean the occupation of the
whole of the Vaṅgas. Gupta inscriptions are recovered from
Puṇḍravardhana, Damodarpur and Rajshahi districts of Bengal
only after the reign of Candragupta II. Moreover, it seems that
the people of Samataṭa had revolted and were joined by other
neighbouring kings<sup>12</sup> and king Candra suppressed the revolt
with his force; eventually the whole of Vaṅga may have come
under his suzerainty.
<P>These considerations apart, palaeographically also the
inscription was considered by Fleet to be later than Samudra-
gupta. Prinsep placed it in the 3rd or 4th Century and Bhau
Daji in the post-Gupta period.<sup>13</sup> But Sircar assigns the record
to the 5th century on the basis of the resemblance of the
marked mātrās or horizontal top-strokes on the letters with
those used in the Bilsad Inscription of Kumāragupta I (A.D.
415-16).<sup>14</sup> This consideration is very important, but Goyal finds
it convenient not to consider it since it goes against his theory.
<P>Moreover, if king Candra of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription
is to be identified with Samudragupta and if it is a posthumous
inscription, there could be a mention of the performance of
Aśvamedha sacrifice by him as is evidenced from his coins.
<P>It is further to be noted that in the Allahabad Pillar
Inscription there is no reference to the conquests of the Vāhli-
kas by samudragupta, though the neighbouring tribes of the
Daivaputras, Ṣāhis and Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas are
mentioned as paying homage to Samudragupta. On the con-
trary, king Candra is said to have conquered the Vāhlikas in
a warfare after crossing the seven mouths of the Sindhu.<sup>15</sup>
[Page-311+ 39]
M.R. Singh<sup>16</sup> and U.N. Roy,<sup>17</sup> however, identify the Vāhlika
in the Panjab and U.N. Roy goes further to identify the Vāhli-
kas with “Daivaputraṣāhi-ṣāhānuṣāhi” i. e. the Kidāra Kuṣāṇas.
But this seems contrary to the statement in the inscription
that king Chandra had conquered the Vāhlikas in warfare,
after having crossed the seven mouths of the river Indus.<sup>18</sup>
<P>So far as the conquests of king Candra in the South are
concerned we submit that it is an eulogy (praśasti) which may
be of the conventional type and may not be entirely historical.
The conventional claim is repeated by some later kings.<sup>19</sup> In
Line 5 of the Mandasor Stone Pillar Inscription we find that
Yaśodharman (A.D. 525-35) boasts to have conquered the
whole country to the west of the Paścima-payodhi and to the
north of the Mahendra (cf. Mahendrācala in the Tirunelveli
district).<sup>20</sup> We know that Candragupta II wielded a great influ-
ence in the south. His daughter Prabhāvatīguptā was married
to the Vākāṭaka king Rudrasena II. There is some evidence to
show that during the regency of Prabhāvatīguptā, Gupta officers
exercised some control over the Vākāṭaka administration.<sup>21</sup>
Further Candragupta II arranged a marriage between his son
and the daughter of Kākutsthavarman, the most powerful ruler
of the Kadamba family in the Kanarese country of the Bombay
Presidency.<sup>22</sup>.
<P>Goyal's assumption that Candra was another name of
Samudragupta is incorrect. We have criticised it earlier on
linguistic and palaeographic considerations. Moreovor, it looks
funny that the name of Candragupta I, his son and his grandson
alike should be the same. Utilising the evidence of Vāmana
that Vasubandhu was the minister of Candraprakāśa, the son of
Candragupta, Goyal quotes Majumdar<sup>23</sup> and takes Candragupta
to be Candragupta I and regards Candraprakāśa as another
name of Samudragupta. But Majumdar himself strikes a note
of caution when he says that “It is not altogether impossible
that Vasubandhu's patron belonged to this<sup>24</sup> or a similar
local dynasty of Ayodhyā”.<sup>25</sup> We cannot associate Vasubandhu
with the Imperial Guptas unless we find any strong evidence
of a positive nature.
<P>Thus we see that the arguments raised by Goyal do not
support his view that Samudragupta is to be identified with
[Page-312+ 43]
Candra. In the absence of any other positive evidence, to the
contrary, the theory of Candra's identification with Candra-
gupta II holds good.<sup>26</sup>

<P>11. I have personally visited Meharaulī to check the reading. The
letter ‘bha’ of ‘Bhūmipatinā’ is identical in form with the letter ‘bha’ of
Bhāvena.
<P>Sircar suggests the reading ‘Devena’, Devagupta being another name
of Candragupta II (Hz. p. 285, note 2). But the view is not plausible.
There was no need of mentioning the king's name again since it is
mentioned as Candra in the preceding line and ‘tena’ refers to that.
Moreover, ‘bhāvena’ here represents, ‘devotion of the king’, the transla-
tion of the whole phrase being: ‘By that king Candra, having a mind full
of devotion (Bhāva=bhākti-bhava) to Lord Viṣṇu, this loftystandard of

{#वत्तिनो(ऽ)भिलिखिता खड्गेन कीत्तिर्भुजे ।#}
<P>If we do the {#अन्वय#} it will run thus:
{#यस्य वङ्गेष्वाहव-वर्त्तिनो#} (revolting) {#शत्रून्समेत्यागतान् उरसा प्रतीपम् उद्वर्त्तयतः#}
{#कीर्त्तिः खड्गेन भुजेऽभिलिखिता ।#}
<P>‘Whose fame of kneading back with his breast the revolting enemies
in Vaṅga uniting together, was inscribed by sword on his arm’. It is a
poetic way of the description of the suppression of revolt. The phrase
{#शत्रून्समेत्यागतान् वङ्गेष्वाहव-वत्तिनी#} suggests ‘the enemies in Vaṅga had revolted
and had come to fight against king Candra uniting together with other
neighbouring kings who might have been afraid by his increasing power.
Any such revolt was possible after the death of Samudragupta. {#उद्वर्त्तयतः#}
{#प्रतीपमुरसा#} suggests that king Candra himself had not gone to fight against
them but he kneaded them back by the force of his breast; the description
is given here metaphorically:
{#यस्य कीर्त्तिः खड्गेन भुजेऽभिलिखिता … ।#}
[Page-313+ 36]
i. e., ‘on whose arm fame was inscribed by the sword’. It is also a poetic
way of describing the victory meaning thereby ‘who had won the battle
by the force of sword in his hand’. Or it may even suggest that he had
won in the battle but his arm was injured which is as if it was a fame
inscribed on his arm by the sword. It was considered a matter of pride
for the commanders and kings to have scars of wounds in battle on the
parts of their bodies.

crossing the seven mouths of the Indus since the inhabitants of this place
were already conquered by Samudragupta and were ruling in obeisance to
the Guptas.

<H>APPENDIX-II
A NOTE ON THE NAME OF THE MOTHER OF
BUDHAGUPTA AND NARASIṂHAGUPTA
<P>In this connexion we have four inscriptions at our disposal:
<HI>(i) Nālandā Clay Seal of Narasiṃhagupta (No. 47)
<HI>(ii) Bhitari inscribed copper-silver Seal of Kumāragupta III
(No. 49).
<HI>(iii) Nālandā baked Clay Seal of Kumāragupta III (No. 50.)
<HI>(iv) Nālandā Clay seal of Budhagupta (No. 53).
<P>In No. 49. L. 6, Sircar<sup>1</sup> takes the reading Candradevī for
the mother of Narasiṃhagupta. It has been read as ‘Śrīvatsa-
devī’ by Fleet. It has been checked by me and the reading
taken by Fleet is found to be correct. The same reading is also
found in No. 50, L. 6.<sup>2</sup>
<P>In No. 47, L. 7, Candradvaī is found to be the name of
Narasiṃhagupta's mother. Hirananda Shastri reads the name
as ‘Śrīvainyadevī’ but he amends the reading as ‘Candradevī’.<sup>3</sup>
Sircar also accepts ‘Candradevī’ as the correct reading.<sup>4</sup>
<P>In No. 53 Candradevī is mentioned as the mother of Budha-
gupta.<sup>5</sup> But Sircar takes the reading ‘Śrī Mahādevī’ though
himself considers it to be doubtful.<sup>6</sup>
<P>Now we find that the inscriptions No. 49 and 50 mention
‘Śrīvatsadevī’ as the mother of Narasiṃhagupta while in No. 47
Candradevī is clearly the name of Narasiṃhagupta's mother. In
No. 53 ‘Candradevī’ is also mentioned as the name of Budha-
gupta's mother.
<P>These different readings have created a confusion about the
names of Budhagupta's and Narasiṃhagupta's mothers. In the
genealogical table Mookerji mentions ‘Candradevī’ as the
mother of both Budhagupta and Narasiṃhagupta.<sup>7</sup> Sircar
writes, “We cannot be sure about the name of Budhagupta's
mother; but she seems to be different from Candradevī, mother
[Page-315+ 17]
of Narasiṃhagupta”.<sup>8</sup> But the objection of Sircar is not valid,
as in the inscriptions No. 49 and 50 Śrīvatsadevī and not
Candradevī is mentioned as the mother of Narasiṃhagupta.
<P>The real difficulty is created by inscriptions No. 47 and 53
when they mention Candradevī as the mother of both Budha-
gupta and Narasiṃhagupta.

<H>APPENDIX-III
EXPLANATION OF THE PASSAGE “PAIṢṬAPURAKA-
MAHENDRAGIRI-KAUṬṬŪRAKA-SVĀMIDATTA”
<P>This expression occurs in L. 19 of the Allahabad Pillar
Inscription of Samudragupta. The compound expression has
been analysed in different ways by various scholars.
<P>Fleet splits it up as:
<P>Paiṣṭapuraka — Mahendragiri-Kauṭṭūraka — Svāmidatta<sup>1</sup> and
translates it as Mahendra of Piṣṭapura, Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra
on the hill.<sup>2</sup>
<P>The first inclination of Fleet<sup>3</sup> is to analyse the expression
thus: ‘Paiṣṭapuraka-Mahendragiri-Kauṭṭūraka-Svāmidatta’ and
to translate it as ‘Mahendragiri of Piṣṭapura, and Svāmidatta
of Koṭṭūra’, but he does not stick to it finding difficulty in
accepting giri or gīr as suitable termination for a king's name,
thinking it only to be used as a religious title.<sup>4</sup>
<P>G. Ramdas<sup>5</sup> takes the whole phrase to be one and translates
it as ‘Svāmidatta, who had his seat at Piṣṭapura and at
Koṭṭūra near Mahendragiri’. This means that Svāmidatta was
the king of both the places. Ramdas supports it by the fact
that in inscriptions we often find the king of Piṣṭapura to have
been the king of Kaliṅga also in which Koṭṭūra is situated.
He also does not accept the name Mahendragiri as of a king, it
being unsupported by history or inscriptions. Bhau Daji<sup>6</sup>
gives another rendering ‘Svāmidatta of Piṣṭapura, Mahendra-
giri, and Koṭṭūra’. But the suggestions of Bhau Daji and
G. Ramdas are untenable, because in that case the reading in the
text, would have been ‘Māhendragirika’ in place of Mahendra-
giri.
<P>As regards the objection that the termination giri or gīr is
used only for Gosāvīs and not for kīngs, even in ancient India
we find people bearing such names as Himādri, Hemādri and
[Page-317+ 35]
Śeṣādri<sup>7</sup> as well as the name Siṃhagiri,<sup>8</sup> all based on terms
signifying mountain.
<P>As rightly pointed out by Bhandarkar,<sup>9</sup> in dividing the text,
the following two considerations are to be kept in view:
<HI>(i) None of the king's name is coupled with more than one
locality.
<HI>(ii) The name of every locality is marked with vṛddhi at the
beginning and with the suffix ‘ka’ at the end.
<P>Thus the only correct division of the text can be: —
Paiṣṭapuraka — Mahendragiri — Kauṭṭūraka — Svāmidatta’.<sup>10</sup> i. e.
Mahendragiri of Piṣṭapura and Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra.

<P>“The vṛddhi in Kauṭṭūraka clearly shows that the word giri preceding
it is to be connected with Mahendra. Again, if giri had really formed
part of the name of the country whose ruler Svāmidatta was, we shall
have had Gairikoṭṭūraka instead of giri-kauṭṭūrka. Secondly, it is not
necessary to take giri here as a denominational suffix similar to that of
giri or gīr of Gosāvīs, as Fleet has done. It is best to understand the whole
of Mahendragiri as one name and as the proper name of the ruler of Piṣṭa-
pura. If the names of the sacred rivers have been adopted as individual
names among Hindu females, the names of the sacred mountains have
similarly been adopted among Hindu males”;
<P>Cf. D.B. Diskalkar, Iz. vol. 1, part II, pp. 35-36; who also very strongly
supports Bhandarkar.

<H>APPENDIX — IV
EXPLANATION OF THE EXPRESSION
“DAIVAPUTRAṢĀHIṢĀHĀNUṢĀHI”
<P>Scholars do not agree in their views about the explanation
of the expression ‘Daivaputraṣāhiṣāhānuṣāhi’ mentioned in line
23 of Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. Daivapu-
tras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas, and Muruṇḍas, and
the people of Siṃhala and all (other) islands are said to have
acknowledged the suzerainty of Samudragupta by rendering to
him all kind of service (sevā) such as coming to the emperor
personally (ātmanivedana) gifts of maidens (Kanyopāyana),
presents (dāna) and application (yācanā) for charters bearing
the Imperial Gupta Garuḍa seal (Garutmadaṅka) by which
they would not be disturbed in the enjoyment (bhukti) and
administration (śāsana) of their respective territories (svaviṣaya).<sup>1</sup>
<P>Fleet, V.A. Smith and Allan split ‘daivaputra-ṣāhi-ṣāhānu-
ṣāhi’ into three different titles denoting three different princes,<sup>2</sup>
who might have been rulers of three smaller states into which
the Kuṣāṇa empire was divided, each one of them appropriat-
ing one of the titles for himself.<sup>3</sup> But Majumdar,<sup>4</sup> Bhandarkar,<sup>5</sup>
Sircar<sup>6</sup> and Raychaudhuri<sup>7</sup> take ‘Daivaputra-ṣāhi-ṣāhānuṣāhi’
to indicate one Kuṣāṇa ruler.
<P>Goyal<sup>8</sup> raises the objection that there was no Kuṣāṇa ruler
so powerful in the third quarter of the fourth century A.D., to
whom could be attributed such a great title as ‘daivaputraṣāhi-
ṣāhānuṣāhi’. He divides the whole expression into two parts
‘daivaputraṣāhi’ and ‘ṣāhānuṣāhi’ to denote two powers.
According to him, the former is to be identified with the
Kidāra Kuṣāṇa king and the latter with Shāhpur II, the Sas-
sanian śāhānśāh. His contention is that the word Devaputra
has not been used as a title, its taddhita form shows that it is
an adjective to the next word ṣāhi.
[Page-319+ 39]
<P>Buddha Prakash<sup>9</sup> gives new suggestion that the whole ex-
pression ‘daivaputraṣāhiṣāhānuṣāhi’ denotes a Persian king.
His assertion is that the Kuṣāṇas had lost their importance and
independence by that time by allying themselves with the
Persians; this is clear from Kālidāsa, who in referring to the
North-Western conquests of Raghu, does not mention the
Śakas but refers only to the Persians.<sup>10</sup> Moreover, in the Kuṣāṇa
records Ṣāhānuṣāhi has never been used as the imperial title of
the Kuṣāṇas and has been a title exclusively employed by the
Sassanian sovereigns. He thus takes ‘devaputra’ to stand for the
Kuṣāṇa king of the Indus valley and Kasmeremaṇḍala and
Ṣāhānuṣāhi for the Sassanian emperor Shāhpur II (A.D. 309-379)
and concludes that, the mention of ‘devaputraṣāhānuṣāhi’ to-
gether suggests an alliance of the Kuṣāṇas with the Sassanians,
cemented by the marriage between the Kuṣāṇa princes and
Hormizd II (A.D. 302-309).<sup>11</sup>
<P>The contention of Dr. Buddha Prakash is unacceptable. He
neglects the word ‘Ṣāhi’ occurring between Daivaputra and
Ṣāhānuṣāhi. Moreover, he takes into his account the word
‘Devaputra’ but does not consider the form of Daivaputra.<sup>12</sup> It
may be noted that the word ‘Shāhi’ has been indiscriminately
used by the Kuṣāṇas, the Hūṇas and by the kings of Kabul,
Turks as well as Hindu kings of the brāhmaṇa clan.<sup>13</sup>
<P>The suggestion of Goyal may likewise be dismissed. In
interpreting the expression we have to keep in our view the
following considerations:
<HI>(i) It is to be noted that ‘Daivaputra’ in itself is an independ-
ent word and its taddhita form denotes those ‘who belong
to Devaputra’, i. e. Kaniṣka<sup>14</sup> (The Kuṣāṇas used Devaputra
as their title).
<HI>(ii) Ṣāhi stands for the Persians or a sub-branch of the Kuṣā-
ṇas;<sup>15</sup> and
<HI>(iii) Ṣāhānuṣāhi for the Sassanians.
Moreover, the context does not suggest any particular referen-
ce to any king by name. Here we have an enumeration of tribes,
viz., the Daivaputras, the Ṣāhis, the Ṣāhānuṣāhis, the Śakas
and the Muruṇḍas.<sup>16</sup>
<P>From the Jain legend {%Kālakācāryakathānaka%} we know:
“The Śaka king who lived on the other side of the Indus used
[Page-320+ 40]
the title Ṣāhānuṣāhi, while his feudatorles were simply styled
Ṣāhis”<sup>17</sup> Chattopadhyaya states that the Śakas never used the
title of Ṣāhānuṣāhi which was mainly a Kuṣāṇa title. Whatever,
may be the truth, but it supports our assertion that the Ṣāhis
and the Ṣāhānuṣāhis were two separate entities and not one.
From the study of {%Kushano-Sassanian Coins,%} we know that these
are the money of the Sassanid prince-governors of Bactria, who
bore the title Kuṣānshāh.<sup>18</sup> It is possible that these Sassanians
who had submitted to Samudragupta; might have reared their
head after his death and were later subjugated again by Cand-
ragupta II, if we believe the evidence of the Meharaulī Iron
Pillar Inscription of Candra is relegated to Candragupta II.

<H>APPENDIX-V
THE RIVERS OF JUNĀGAṚH
<P>The names of the rivers, mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Inscrip-
tion of Skandagupta, as issuing from the mountain Raivataka<sup>1</sup>
or Ūrjayat<sup>2</sup> have been disputed. Fleet explains ‘Palāśinīyam
Sikatāvilāsinī’ as ‘Palāśinī, beautiful with (its) sandy stretches’.<sup>3</sup>
D.C. Sircar takes Sikatā to be Suvarṇasikatā which is the same
as modern Soṇarekhā.<sup>4</sup> R.B. Pandey regards Sikatā to be the
same Suvarṇasikatā mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Inscription of
Rudradāman and as identical with Suvarṇarekhā which flows
at the foot of Girnar hill.<sup>5</sup> H.D. Sankalia while discussing the
names of mountains Girinagara, Ūrjayat and Raivataka, and
the rivers at Junāgaṛh does not consider these disputed lines of
the Junāgaṛh Inscription of Skandagupta. He only discusses
Suvarṇasikatā and Palāśinī on the basis of the Junāgaṛh In-
scription of Rudradāman I<sup>6</sup>.
<P>Those who disagree with Fleet's interpretation that ‘Sikatā-
vilāsinī’ is an adjective of Palāśinī and take Sikatā to refer to
Suvarṇasikatā, neglect the word Vilāsinī. Evidently Vilāsinī is
the name of a third river. The construction is also in plural. The
composer of the inscription is naming all the rivers of the area
which had gone to meet their husband, the ocean, in due accord-
ance with the scriptures.<sup>7</sup> The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Māgha,
in describing the Raivataka mountain gives a similar account
of these rivers in the rainy season.<sup>8</sup>
<P>In the accompanying map besides the two rivers Ojat and
Uben on the sides of Jūnāgaṛh, we find the river Fuljar and a
number of streams, viz., Nonpuria, Sonrakhi, Lotus and Fuljar.
Sonrakhi is evidently Suvarṇarekhā, Fuljar may be the river
Palāśinī and the Lotus may be equated with Vilāsinī. The
river Ojat has some resemblance with the mountain Ūrjayat.
<P>The rivers due to the flood caused by excessive rains had
[Page-322+ 1]
<Picture>
[Page-323+ 35]
combined into one; with the flowers fallen from trees growing
on the banks of these rivers, it looked as if a hand decorated
with flowers was stretched by the mountain Raivataka desirous
of appropriating the wives of the mighty ocean, having noticed
the great bewilderment of the Sea caused by the excess of rain.<sup>9</sup>
Fleet's rendering of the passage<sup>10</sup> does not seem to be appro-
priate. The line ‘aneka-tīrāntaja-puṣpa-śobhito nadīmayo hasta
iva prasāritaḥ’ shows that here is a reference to a group of many
rivers and not to one river alone.
